	how python code works in hardware of the computer 
	how python code works with computers 0 and 1        - via compiler 

	why use python ? = inorder to understand and work with computer we created programming langauages so that both the computer and human can talk to each other (like english for human to human talk)
	what all can be done and made with python  

	interpreter , COMPILER   |  THEIR DIFFERENCE 
	who is responisble for converting the source code into byte code 
	what is a byte code ? 
	how text editor work with python ?  are they compilers ??   
	structure of how python code works from secondary memory to main memory to cpu ? 
	shell , ide , script 
	why and how pip works  - show the code of it 
	how packages work as funciton 
	whats memory in python , how memory gets consumed while coding programs ?
	whats the repository of the python packages ?   ,    where are all these packages installed while we pip install 

	
	alternative way to create objects with @class method 
	=  if we assign the string to the class  where
	EMP.from_str(str) is passed 
	how this class method created for the (input of string ) will carry the info of the constructor where  3 arguments needs to be passed 
	- name, salary , age 
	how class method determines the init constructor created inside the class ? 
	(as the arguments are passed - we dont even which constructor gets which value ?)
	# == no , u define the constructor with the args = that makes sure inside the str  u define the args but in init u combined it with init.split()

	

	PREFERENCE 
	FIRST FROM child  INSTANCE method > ATTRIBUTE - THEN child CLASS  ATTRIBUTE - >>> THEN parent   CLASS'S[ INSTANCE ATTRIBUTE] - THEN parent CLASS  ATTRIBUTE


	Q but why we need to type 
 	class newname:
          pass     > when instance needs to take attribute value  from the previous class's attribute 

	when i run super() method > [ i copy the init of parent class and we define the values with super method().__init(as arguments )   but 
	when i create the object of the child  class i pass the arguments again ! 
	Q whats the difference of args   between them   ?
=  because  for child u have different args but u take the params from the parent , child order of giving values will depend upon child init  
    and why arguments of the init super class method are prefferabled more than the arguments listed down when we create the object , while calling the function  !?
>>>   it is because , when we use super().__init__ method  
		- we didn't specify each attribute of new class                  self.name = name , self.age = age 
		- this makes the new class reads arguments with super method().__init('as', 'arguments' )
		- if we specify each attribute with self after super method , it reads arguments when we call the object r8 = Bmw('ok',5,'BLACK')



# Servers !
difference between local host and  .html file  > we can use .html file as well for testing and development purposes 

Different type of servers 
why differernt type of servers are used(web , application , mail server ) & why only http/https is shown when data gets travelled in requests via internet
	because that is the room number via which package is deliveered 
	- we request goes to GUI which are connected to the Database server 
where we do we see other type of protocols - smtp, ftp,tcp...
who controls the web server  - employees 

how https works in tcp model . how bytes of data gets transferred from physical layer in tcp/ip model = signals 
 
where and why tcp/ip model is used , who and y udp is brought - that is the means 
what is Xampp - used when running database and apache server

why binary number system is used ? 
how 256 values are stored in BYTE  
How ascii store only 127 values 
why utf-8 was used?


are these server s placed under various networks ?      or subnets ?  everyone in world is connected with unique public ip but private server have common ip address for each org
by whom and how are these networks provided to them ?  IANA
how private companies get their network  ? or private network 

how internet is distrbibuted  between classful and classles addresses 
- wont they interfer ? 
how aws server get their network 

how my laptop and all other world pc are given ip addresses ? 

what if multiple requests sent to server or it crashes 

differently managed by each company ?

  #COMPLETED 
def __init__(self , age):   # age given , so arg needs to be given 
if we assign self.age = 21
a= class() >>> remember init works with call ()  so its upto u , u assign paramteres - assign args too!     ,   if no parameteres then assign values in init only 
a.call('OVER HERE') - when calling do we need to assign argument,          
can't the object automatically check value of 21 is given .

 multiplication table in float !  # completed 



Q if u give def __init__(self):
             self.age = 21      # here we directly give objects attribute - not by calling function 
 tushar.getage()                 # we need to call function as self.age is stored in function
 print(tushar.age)               # to call the object attributes 
 THUS , U DONT NEED TO use parameter in def() ,You can use self directly with attribute and thus call the attribute with the object '''


             def __init__(self,name,classs,salary):

                        self.classs=classs

                        print(f'name = {self.name} , class = {self.classs} , salary ={self.salary}')

 HERE   WE  need to give values down to function when called ()                    >>> because in init we specified the parameters , thus need to assign args when call
# thus when define self.age or whatevr params , we need to give args , because self means object attributes 





Q  slice the attribtue when called in the arguments  | a = person(22)  |  print(a)  |   print(type(a))
class company:
    name = 'tushar'
    salary = ('tushar'[::-1],3,442) , ('ok') , ['ok',23,4,4] 
    set    = {1,3,'hi'}

tushar = company()

print(company.name , tushar.name[::-1] , tushar.salary[::-1])


- when defining child class , is it mandatory to copy all the objects in child class,
 what if i want only the name from parent class ? 
   =inherit and distibute params and args accordingly  - just inherit the parent and specify in child init 


- want  to copy only the first name or attribtue of parent class objects and display in child class ? 
  use super().__init__(object_name) and pass that only object in class 


Q how will u use funciton outside to define class 


Q use *args , **kwargs ,default arg and init arguments in def arguments 
Q use **kwargs to pass multiple values in class init arguments


@ if parent class has **kname in init and i use super() method to bring values in child , 
so without using **kwargs , can i give keyword arguments ?? 
    - YES , parent do their job , child perform their own job 


Q print list in Zigzag  like   1,2  3,4 ,56,
    # for i,v in enumerate(a):
    #     if i==0 or i%2==0:
    #         print(v ,end=':')
    #     else:                   # continue 
    #         print(v,'\n')

if default arg is given for single param  
 and 2 args given for seperately for *arguments , 
 but i dont want to give normal arg for default parameter and still utilize the other 2 arguments for *args like tuple  , how can it be ? 
 
    # de =' d'
    # def n( de='default',*args ,**kwargs):
    #     print(args,kwargs)
    # n('tushar','ok',0,1,de,name='==main',Truee=False,_='tuh')


@new method

@ is    vs   == ?   >>> is check id and == check values 

 yield  where is it used   ?  diff with return  yield makes iterables on the fly , helps to save ram , runs by __next__()
 == generate values on the fly 
-  use iter(mutable_data_type) and use next() to get the values
-  use yield to get the values where it is inside function 


 DIFFERENCE between mal_func = functools.partial(mal_num,num)
 and decorators  |  here with partial u can assign arg at later stage
