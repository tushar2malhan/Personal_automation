users > user1 >  add permissions > attach existing policy > search and add policy  (IAM read only access) 
* If u add user1 in devs group , so user will contain both individual as well as Group permissions and policies


Access Aws 
- by management console 
- aws cli by access keys 
- sdk python boto3 


iam user to create security credentials not by root user (lock it and throw it away)


CLI 
- CLI blank if permissions to user not provided 
    -- aws configure [ give id and pass , nearest region    ]
    -- aws iam list-users                  # list all users
    -- aws iam create-user                 # create user

IAM roles for aws services 
- can be used on iam users to access iam services as well
- used by aws services to access aws services ( one iam role + ec2 server == 1 entity )


Security Tools
IAM Security tools 
    - Credentials Report > get all info about iam users passwords and their info 
    - Click User > Access Advisor > shows the list of resources used by them and at what time
      which is  binded by the Polcy permission
    - One Iam user is one physical user , make groups for multiple users , enable mFa + password policy , 
    - Create and use ROLES for giving permissions to aws services ( EC2 or S3 use IAM roles )
    - Never share IAM users and ACCESS keys 
    
IAM roles define the set of permissions for making AWS service request whereas 
IAM policies define the permissions that you will require.... 
IAM roles are like users and policies are like permissions
