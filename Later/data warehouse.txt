
bi = is the activity that contribute to growth of the company by transforming raw operational data into useful information for data analysis.
   > it extracts info from company's operational systems.
   > data is transformed and loaded in data warehouses.
   > thus , used for bussiness insights.  BY USERS FROM WAREHOUSE
eg - sales , employement , profit annual data stored in databases , excel

WHY we need data warehouses ?
 >>> because data collected from various sources & stored in seperate database cannot be directly VISUALIZED\
   FROM DATA SOURCES = data needs to be integrated and processed before VISUALIZATION  takes place.

your COMPANY'S data stored in 
     data  sources  like sql server , sap hana , oracle 
       >     DATA WAREHOUSE 
             >      DATA VISUALIZATION


WHAT IS data warehouses ? 
 a central location where consolidated data from multiple loactions (data sources) are stored
 . THIS WAREHOUSE is maintained seperatly from organisations operational database
 (so that company's operational data won't get affected)   # DATA BACKUP OF UR COMPANY
 . end users can directly access it  inoder to modify  via OLAP 
   (EG od end users  can be bussiness analytics , data scientist)


PROCESS of transferring data from multiple  sources into a data warehouses = ETL 
(EXTRACTION , TRANSFORM , LOAD )
> from data warehouse use OLAP STRATEGY[online analytic processing]  
to do bussiness analysis  BY THE END USERS.
FOR VISUALIZATION , INSIGHTS U CAN DO tabllieu , flipu
(data warehouse does not load every time new data is added to database)
DATA WAREHOUSE == LEGACY DATA (OLD) WHICH IS USED FOR VISUALIZATION BY END USERS.


WHERE are data warehouses located?  ON SITE PREMISES
Data warehouses are used as centralized data repositories for analytical and reporting purposes.
A traditional data warehouse is located on-site at your offices. 
You purchase the hardware, the server rooms and hire the staff to run it.


"" data from multiple sources > database operational DATA > ETL > (only legacy data ) DATA WAREHOUSE > VIA OLAP VISUALIZATION FOR END USERS   ""

DATABASE warehouse can't be a product where it's bought and sold,
 NEEDS TO BE DESIGNED AND DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE COMPANY REQUIREMENT

EACH TABLE OR DATABASE needs to have relation inorder to store it in data warehouse
DATA WAREHOUSE == structured AND  RELTIONAL DATA
WAREHOUSE IS faster AND ACCURATE

properties of data warehouse
- stored by subject 
- collected from series of snapshots , have time logs details (when , why , whom by which it was stored)
- DATA IS NOT UPDATED OR DELETED (no change = no corruption)

eg in retail company  , inorder to get information about how sales were done , how marketing happened,
how operations are done for particular month >> get info by data warehouse


OLTP = DATABASE   
running  queries on database is called online transaction processing 
contains current data and legacy data (RELATIONAL data)
helpful in running the bussiness
based on RELATIONAL model
HERE U WRITE THE DATA , any new updates database NEEDS TO BE UPDATED
size 100 MB - 1 GB
eg bank server which records for every transaction made by customer for particular account

OLAP = DATA WAREHOUSE (DWH)  online analytical processing
helpful in analysing the bussiness
based on star , snowflake schema
HERE U READ DATA - NO  NEED TO UPDATE EVERYTIME
SIZE 100GB - 1 TB
eg bank manager needs to know how many customers using atm of his branch, based on that he may take  a call to continue with atm or not



S3 = DATA LAKE (storing all types of data )
[structured , semi structured , unstructured data] , from s3 data goes into redshift
if size of redshift grows it shfts data into s3 
, here speed matters for specific datatype as nosql stored in s3 is slow as compared to dynomo db
[whereas redshift is relational database warehouse] giving analytical tools, BI , reporting data


Unlike Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), we cannot call Hadoop a database, 
but it is more of a distributed file system that can store and process a huge volume of data sets across a cluster of computers.
COMPONENTS -
 HDFS      -  for storage layer - storing huge amounts of data
 MapReduce, which is a programming model that help process huge data sets.
 Hadoop YARN, which helps in managing the computing resources in multiple clusters
 Hadoop is not a type of database, but rather a software ecosystem that allows for massively parallel computing
 It is an enabler of certain types NoSQL distributed databases (such as HBase), which can allow for data to be spread across thousands of servers with little reduction in performance
