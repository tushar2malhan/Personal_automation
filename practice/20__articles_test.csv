1,"Sleep Consolidation, Sleep Problems, and Co-Sleeping: Rethinking Normal Infant Sleep as Species-Typical","Infants evolved in the context of close contact (including co-sleeping). Evolutionary context is rarely considered in psychological infant sleep research, and Western sleep researchers make assumptions about what optimal ""normal"" infant sleep is and how to achieve early, deep, infant sleep consolidation and avoid infant sleep problems. However, an evolutionary and anthropological view of infant sleep as species-typical recognizes that human evolution likely prepared the infant brain for optimal development within its evolutionary context - co-sleeping. Thus, ""normal"" infant sleep, sleep consolidation, and sleep problems should all be understood within the framework of co-sleeping infants, not the historically new-phenomenon of solitary-sleeping infants. Much work needs to be done in order to understand ""normal"" infant sleep as species-typical and how adaptive infants are to environments that stray from their evolutionary norm.","Affiliation 1 Human Development & Family Studies, Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus, Lemont Furnace, PA, USA.",Elaine S Barry ,J Genet Psychol,2021 Jul-Aug,"Biological Evolution*,Humans,Infant,Mother-Child Relations*,Psychology, Social,Reference Values,Sleep Wake Disorders* / etiology,Sleep Wake Disorders* / psychology,Sleep*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33783334
2,Episodic memory consolidation during sleep in healthy aging,"Sleep benefits the stabilization of newly acquired information - a process known as memory consolidation. Age-related alterations in sleep physiology may affect memory consolidation and account for reduced episodic memory performance in healthy older individuals. The striking parallelism of age-related changes in sleep and episodic memory has provoked a considerable increment in empirical studies investigating the link between age-related changes in sleep and memory. Still, evidence remains inconclusive under which circumstances and by which mechanisms memory consolidation is affected during aging. In this review we provide an exhaustive summary of the status quo of research on episodic memory consolidation during sleep in healthy aging. On this basis, we derive a cohesive explanatory framework to understand age-related changes in consolidation mechanisms during sleep. Consolidation impairments are not solely caused by sleep changes but arise in synergy with age-related alterations in brain structure and neuromodulation. We argue that sleep oscillations during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep guide the reactivation, integration, and redistribution of memory traces. Neuromodulators supporting these mechanisms change in old age. In combination with alterations in brain structure, the generation of sleep oscillations during NREM sleep is impaired, their coordination becomes diffuse, and the processes necessary to render stable episodic memories are impaired.","Affiliations 1 Center for Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin, Germany.

3,Maternal and neonatal serum expression of the vascular growth factors in hyperglycemia in pregnancy,"Introduction: Hyperglycemia in pregnancy (HIP) occurs in up to 8-17% of pregnancies. Unfavorable impact of the pregnancy induced hyperglycemia on both maternal and fetal tissues is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Vascular growth factors, especially in the early phase of gestation, are considered as one of the most significant molecules that regulate pregnancy course and their serum expression may be altered in patients affected with HIP. Material and methods: Fifty-five consecutive pregnant patients who underwent elective cesarean section were incorporated into this study. During the surgery, maternal and cord blood samples were collected. Serum expression levels of vascular growth factors: PlGF, VEGF, THBS-2 and Ang-2 were compared among non-HIP and pregnancies affected by gestational diabetes. Subsequently, laboratory results were correlated with obstetric outcomes. Results: There were no statistical differences in maternal characteristics, neonatal outcomes and maternal or neonatal serum levels between study and control groups. However, our results revealed significant differences between fetal and maternal levels of VEGF (p = .028 and .0001), THBS-2 (p = .013 and .0014) and Ang-2 (p = .035 and .048) for HIP and non-HIP group, respectively. Conclusions: Similar serum expressions of vascular growth factors in and non-HIP and HIP pregnancies point that normal glycemia due to thorough prenatal surveillance may result in normal angio- and vasculogenesis associated with good pregnancy outcomes.","Affiliations 1 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. 2 Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.","Filip A Dabrowski , Michal Lipa , Zbigniew Bartoszewicz , Miroslaw Wielgos , Dorota A Bomba-Opon ",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,2021 May,"Cesarean Section,Diabetes, Gestational*,Female,Humans,Hyperglycemia*,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31307255
4,Outcomes of pregnancy in simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant recipients: A single-center retrospective study,"Simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplantation, in uremic women with insulin-dependent diabetes, increases the chance of a successful pregnancy and minimizes the risk to infants. The aim of this study was to document pregnancy and explore the challenges in this cohort of women. Retrospective analysis of women who underwent pancreas transplantation between January 1, 1998 and 8 January, 2019 was conducted. Seventeen pregnancies were identified in 13 women. Mean transplant-to-pregnancy interval was 4.6 years (range, 1.1-10.2 years). Eleven pregnancies resulted in live birth (65%), and six (35%) ended in miscarriage/fetal loss at a median gestational age of 8.5 weeks. Mean gestational age at delivery was 34.9 weeks (SD ±3 weeks). Preeclampsia and C-section rates were 77% and 67%, respectively. Adverse fetal and graft outcomes were observed in 100% of unplanned pregnancies, compared to 10% of planned pregnancies (P < .001). One kidney allograft was lost during pregnancy; one pancreas and two kidney allografts were lost within 3 years of pregnancy. This is a high-risk group for grafts and offspring. Pre-pregnancy planning is vital. A multidisciplinary approach by obstetric and transplant teams is important pre-pregnancy, antenatally, and peripartum. This is the largest published series of pregnancies in SPK recipients from a single center.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. 2 Women's Services Directorate, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.","Sai Rithin Punjala , Benedict Lyle Phillips , Paramit Chowdhury , Taryn Pile , Nikolaos Karydis , Nicos Kessaris , Jonathon Olsburgh , Kate Harding , Chris J Callaghan , Catherine Nelson-Piercy , Martin Drage ",Clin Transplant,2021 Oct,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1* / surgery,Female,Graft Survival,Humans,Infant,Kidney Transplantation*,Pancreas,Pancreas Transplantation*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34292634
5,Intrauterine device use is safe among nulligravidas and adolescent girls,"The use of intrauterine devices (IUDs), including the copper-bearing device and the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), is safe among nulligravidas and adolescent girls. However, several misconceptions limit their use in clinical practice; health-care providers are hesitant to prescribe IUDs, and several myths associated with their usage in nulligravidas and adolescents exist among both providers and women themselves. The high rates of unplanned pregnancies (which in many settings constitute a public health issue, primarily among adolescent females) can be attributed at least partially to lack of awareness and limited use of highly effective contraceptives such as IUDs. In this review, we discuss the role of non-hormonal and hormonal IUDs as effective contraceptives in nulligravidas and adolescent girls. We present a literature review of data that highlight contraceptive efficacy, side effects (including reasons for discontinuation), and continuation rates with the method. We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus databases for all articles published in English between January 1990 through September 2020. A large body of evidence confirmed the effectiveness of IUD/IUS, independent of age and parity. Studies showed a high expulsion rate among adolescents but not among nulligravidas. Additionally, bleeding patterns among adolescents and nulligravidas were similar to those observed among adults and parous women. The high early removal rates observed in adolescents were attributable to bleeding and/or pain, which indicate that compared with adults, adolescents are less likely to accept IUD-induced side effects. IUD placement is an excellent strategy to avoid the high rates of unplanned pregnancies in adolescents and nulligravidas. IUDs are more effective than short-acting reversible contraceptives with failure rates that are equivalent to those observed with permanent contraception. However, few long-term studies have investigated this category of women to definitively establish the role of IUD/IUS as effective means of contraception.","Affiliations 1 Latin American Center of Perinatology, Women's Health and Reproduction (CLAP/SMR), Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization, Montevideo, Uruguay. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil.","M Valeria Bahamondes , Luis Bahamondes ",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,2021 Apr,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Adolescent,Female,Gravidity,Humans,Intrauterine Devices, Copper*,Intrauterine Devices, Medicated*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy in Adolescence / prevention & control*,Pregnancy, Unwanted",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33483956
6,Parental Depression and Contextual Selection: The Case of School Choice,"Parental depression constricts children's development, but the mechanisms implicated-beyond daily parenting tactics-remain unknown. Today, parents must evaluate and select environmental contexts for child-rearing within increasingly complex residential and educational markets. Depression may hamper parents' abilities to navigate this terrain, constraining information collection and impairing child-oriented decision-making. In turn, depressed parents' children may lack access to developmentally enriching neighborhood, school, and child care settings. K-12 school sorting offers a strategic case to assess these expectations, given proliferating nontraditional options and school quality data. Analyses using the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (N = 2,754) linked to administrative data suggest that depressed parents' children attend magnet, charter, or private schools at lower rates than similarly situated children of nondepressed parents; depression-based disparities appear largest among Latino and Black families. The study motivates future research examining whether the depression-contextual selection link mediates intergenerational processes and exacerbates segregation.","Affiliation 1 University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.",Jared N Schachner ,J Health Soc Behav,2021 Jun,"Child,Child Rearing,Depression*,Humans,Parenting*,Parents,Schools",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33870761
7,[Pillars for excellence in nutrition support units. Training],"Few areas of current medicine have undergone change and evolution in recent years such as those of clinical nutrition. Currently, 98 % of endocrinology and nutrition departments in hospitals with 500 or more beds incorporate a clinical nutrition and dietetics Unit. The training of the professionals that integrate these units has been and will be a key point in their ongoing development towards excellence. In medicine degree studies, despite its relevance, nutrition training is currently scarce and heterogeneous, and needs improvement, which may come hand in hand with the recently published ESPEN proposals. In the case of doctors specializing in endocrinology and nutrition, the adaptations in the teaching program established by the National Commission for this specialty, and the training efforts led by the SEEN have allowed significant improvement. In hospital pharmacy studies there is a nutrition training curriculum that could be updated. University training in nutrition within the nursing degree is also heterogeneous. The most related studies such as the Degree of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, Technician in Dietetics, Food Science and Technology or Bromatology fundamentally address issues related to dietetics. There is a lack of coordinated effort to define the role of the members of these multidisciplinary UNCyDs, also in regard to their training.",Affiliations 1 Unidad de Nutrición Clínica y Dietética.

8,Sleep-Wake Disturbances and Episodic Memory in Older Adults,"Sleep-wake disturbances have been associated with episodic memory loss, but past studies were limited by use of single measures of objective or perceived disturbances. Notably, cognitive reserve and depressive symptoms have been associated with sleep-wake disturbances and poorer episodic memory in older adults. The aims of this study were to determine the relationship between episodic memory and sleep-wake disturbances using objective and perceived measures in older adults and to examine cognitive reserve and depressive symptoms as moderators of this relationship. In this descriptive study, 62 healthy older adults (mean age: 69.9 years; 75.8% women) were recruited from the University of Michigan Clinical Research Program. Objective sleep-wake disturbances were measured by 7-day actigraphy and perceived sleep-wake disturbances by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Episodic memory was measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. Analyses involved Pearson's correlation coefficients and hierarchical multiple regression. Results showed that more objectively measured sleep disruption was associated with poorer episodic memory and more perceived daytime sleepiness was associated with better episodic memory. Cognitive reserve and depressive symptoms were not moderators of this relationship. In this study, the relationship between sleep-wake disturbances and episodic memory differed by type of measure, objective or perceived. Future studies are needed using multiple measures of episodic memory to further understand the sleep-wake disturbances and episodic memory relationship in a larger diverse sample of healthy older adults.","Affiliations 1 Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing, 5924Hunter College, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA. 2 School of Nursing, 14686Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA. 3 School of Nursing, 1259University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 4 College of Nursing-Omaha Division, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA. 5 Department of Psychiatry, Neurology, and Psychology, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, MI, USA.","An-Yun Yeh , Susan J Pressler , Donna Algase , Laura M Struble , Bunny J Pozehl , Ann M Berger , Bruno J Giordani ",Biol Res Nurs,2021 Apr,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Actigraphy,Aged,Aging / physiology*,Female,Humans,Male,Memory, Episodic*,Sleep / physiology,Sleep Wake Disorders / physiopathology*,Sleepiness",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32648471
9,Increasing parenting self-efficacy: The Fussy Baby Network ® intervention,"High levels of infant crying place families at risk for disrupted relationships, parenting stress, and even for child maltreatment. We conducted an evaluation of the Fussy Baby Network® (FBN), a program supporting families struggling with infant crying and related concerns. The study contrasted 29 families who sought help from FBN with 27 families with excessively crying infants who did not seek services. Researchers measured parenting self-efficacy, depression, and stress in each group before and after the intervention. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated greater improvements over time in parenting self-efficacy for parents receiving FBN services. Furthermore, the greater improvements in parenting self-efficacy in the intervention group were not directly attributable to reductions in infant crying. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the FBN approach may be effective at boosting the confidence of parents struggling with caring for their infants. Future research with larger samples with baseline equivalence and stronger research designs should explore this intervention further. This study also suggests that interventions for families with excessively crying infants should move beyond the focus of reducing infant crying to a broader strategy of supporting parents and strengthening relationships between parents and their infants to build parenting capacity.","Affiliations 1 Erikson Institute, Chicago, Illinois. 2 Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. 3 National Louis University, Chicago, Illinois. 4 University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.","Linda Gilkerson , Tiffany Burkhardt , Leslie E Katch , Sydney L Hans ",Infant Ment Health J,2020 Mar,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Colic / therapy,Crying*,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant Behavior*,Infant, Newborn,Male,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology,Program Evaluation,Self Efficacy*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32242969
10,Refining Angular Pregnancy Diagnosis in the First Trimester: A Case Series of Expectant Management,"Objective: To describe the natural history and outcomes of a large cohort of expectantly managed angular pregnancies diagnosed in the first trimester by specific ultrasound criteria. Methods: We conducted a prospective case series of women with prenatally diagnosed angular pregnancy at a single academic tertiary care center from March 2017 to February 2019. Participants were identified at first-trimester ultrasound scan using specifically proposed diagnostic criteria for angular pregnancy and followed prospectively. Maternal and fetal data were gathered from the medical record. Results: Forty-two cases of angular pregnancy were identified at first-trimester ultrasound scan. At presentation, 33 patients (79%) were asymptomatic, eight (19%) had vaginal bleeding, and two (5%) had pain. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 7.4±1.0 weeks; the mean myometrial thickness was 5.1±1.6 mm (95% CI 4.6-5.6). At initial follow-up about 2 weeks later, 23 patients (55%) had ultrasound scans that normalized, 13 (31%) cases persisted as angular pregnancies, and six (14%) resulted in early pregnancy loss. After each gestation had been followed until completion, 33 (80%) pregnancies resulted in live birth and eight (20%) in early pregnancy loss. One patient was lost to follow-up. Of the 33 live births, 24 (73%) were vaginal deliveries, nine (27%) were cesarean deliveries, 27 (82%) were term deliveries, and six (18%) were preterm deliveries. There were no cases of uterine rupture, maternal death, abnormal placentation, or hysterectomy. Conclusions: In 42 cases of angular pregnancy diagnosed by first-trimester ultrasound examination, outcomes were largely positive, with an 80% live-birth rate and a 20% early pregnancy loss rate. Early diagnosis of angular pregnancy using the described criteria may represent an entity that more closely resembles a normal, noneccentric intrauterine pregnancy rather than an ectopic pregnancy. Therefore, most cases can be closely observed and efforts made to expectantly manage pregnancies while awaiting viability.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri.","Kassie J Bollig , Danny J Schust",Obstet Gynecol,2020 Jan,"Abortion, Spontaneous / etiology,Adult,Delivery, Obstetric*,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy Trimester, First*,Pregnancy, Angular / diagnostic imaging*,Pregnancy, Angular / therapy,Prospective Studies,Tertiary Care Centers,Ultrasonography, Prenatal,Watchful Waiting*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31809430
11,Benzodiazepine use before conception and risk of ectopic pregnancy,"Study question: Are women who fill a benzodiazepine prescription before conception at increased risk of ectopic pregnancy? Summary answer: Risk of ectopic pregnancy is 50% higher among women who fill a benzodiazepine prescription before conception. What is known already: Benzodiazepine use in pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, adverse birth outcomes and adverse child development outcomes. Study design, size, duration: Using data from US commercial insurance claims, we performed a cohort study of 1 691 366 pregnancies between 1 November 2008 and 30 September 2015. Participants/materials, setting, methods: We identified ectopic pregnancies using diagnosis and procedure codes and used unadjusted and inverse probability of treatment (IPT)-weighted log-binomial models to calculate relative risks (RR) of ectopic pregnancy for pregnant women who did and did not fill any prescriptions for benzodiazepines in the 90 days before conception. Two sub-groups of women with specific indications for benzodiazepine use were also examined-women who had a least one diagnosis for anxiety disorder and women who had at least one diagnosis of insomnia in the year before conception. Main results and the role of chance: Of the 1 691 366 pregnancies, 1.06% filled at least two benzodiazepine prescriptions totaling at least 10 days supply in the 90 days before conception. Among women with a benzodiazepine prescription, there was an excess of 80 ectopic pregnancies per 10 000 pregnancies, and their IPT-weighted risk of ectopic pregnancies was 1.47 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.63) times greater relative to women without benzodiazepine prescriptions before conception. The IPT-weighted RR between ectopic pregnancy and benzodiazepine use was 1.34 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.53) among women with anxiety disorder diagnoses and 1.28 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.68) among women with an insomnia diagnosis. Limitations, reasons for caution: We relied on outpatient prescription data to identify benzodiazepine use before conception, which could result in over- or under-estimation of actual benzodiazepine consumption. We relied on medical claim codes to identify pregnancies and conception date, which may result in misclassification of pregnancy outcomes and gestational length. Wider implications of the findings: This study found that women who have a benzodiazepine prescription before conception are at an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. This information can help women, and their healthcare providers make more fully informed decisions about benzodiazepine use in their reproductive years.

12,Parenting and parental burnout in Africa,"A recent initiative known as the International Investigation of Parental Burnout, sought to study the prevalence of parental burnout in over 40 countries globally using the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA) instrument. Four countries investigated here provide a first insight into parental burnout in Africa, based on a pooled dataset of 738 parents (48.8% mothers) sampled from Burundi (n = 187; 25.3%), Cameroon (n = 208; 28.2%), Rwanda (n = 240; 32.5%), and Togo (n = 103; 14%). As a first step, we tested the content validity of the PBA that was developed and validated in Western countries. Second, we tested the relations between the PBA and several sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, and level of education. The results provide evidence that the concept of parental burnout makes sense for African parents, and that the PBA can be considered as a psychometrically sound instrument to measure it. However, the results also point to the need for further exploration of the nature of parental burnout in Africa. As in previous studies, low correlations between parental burnout and the sociodemographic characteristics were found. Finally, the current results suggest the existence of parenting subcultures across the four participating countries that would be interesting to document.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Limpopo, Sovenga, South Africa. 2 Department of Psychology, University of Lomé, Lomé, Togo. 3 Département STAPS, Université de Limoges, Limoges, France. 4 Clinique de l'Education et de la Psychothérapie CEP, Bujumbura, Burundi. 5 Département de psychologie, Université de Yaoundé I, Yaoundé, Cameroun. 6 College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda.","Tholene Sodi , Lodegaèna Bassantéa Kpassagou , Ogma Hatta , Alexis Ndayizigiye , Jean-Marie Ndayipfukamiye , Josué Ngnombouowo Tenkué , Claire Bahati , Vincent Sezibera ",New Dir Child Adolesc Dev,2020 Nov,"Africa,Burnout, Psychological*,Humans,Parenting*,Parents,Rwanda",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33206468
13,Perspectives on COVID-19 prevention and treatment using herbal medicine in Vietnam: A cross-sectional study,"Introduction: The significance of herbal medicine (HM) during the COVID-19 pandemic has been confirmed. Nevertheless, limited studies have included the people perspectives on COVID-19 prevention/treatment using herbal medicine in Vietnam. Thus, this study tackled the aforementioned issue. Methods: Online-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Vietnamese adults between February-April 2021. Descriptive analysis, regression and Chi-squared tests were implemented for the statistical purposes. Results: total of 787 respondents attended the study, 368 (46.8%) confirmed that they use herbal medicine/nutritional supplements for COVID-19 prevention/treatment. Over 50% of the respondents possessed positive perspective on vitamin C ingestion. Using herbal medicine for external use as a disinfectant was mostly preferred. Respondents who had a 'very good' health self-perception or who lived in rural areas, were more likely to have a positive opinion in the COVID-19 prevention/treatment using herbal medicine. The main barrier for herbal medicine utilization was the deficiency of personal experience or expert advice. Conclusion: The Vietnamese people commonly utilize herbal medicine for the COVID-19 prevention/treatment. These data might help policy-makers in managing the public knowledge and practice on herbal medicine use in Vietnam.","Affiliations 1 Department of Drug Administration, Faculty of Pharmacy, Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Can Tho, Vietnam. 2 Department of Traditional Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Can Tho, Vietnam. 3 Department of Chemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Can Tho University, Campus II, Can Tho, Vietnam. 4 Department of Biology - Genetics, Faculty of Basic Science, Can Tho University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Can Tho, Vietnam. 5 Pharmaceutical Management and Economics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Egyptian Russian University, Cairo, Egypt. 6 Pharmaceutical Management and Economics, Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia. 7 Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom. 8 Department of Traditional Medicine, Can Tho General Hospital, Can Tho, Vietnam.","V D Tran , V D Tran , D T Pham , T T N Cao , M Bahlol , R S Dewey , M H Le , V A Nguyen ",Ann Ig,2022 Sep-Oct,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882168

15,Comparing Prospective and Retrospective Reports of Pregnancy Intention in a Longitudinal Cohort of U.S. Women,"Context: Measurement of pregnancy intentions typically relies on retrospective reporting, an approach that may misrepresent the extent of unintended pregnancy. However, the degree of possible misreporting is unclear, as little research has compared prospective and retrospective reports of intention for the same pregnancies. Methods: Longitudinal data collected between 2010 and 2015 on 174 pregnancies were used to analyze the magnitude and direction of changes in intendedness (intended, ambivalent or unintended) between prospective and retrospective measurements of intendedness using versions of the London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP). Changes were assessed both continuously and categorically. Differences in the degree of change-by pregnancy outcome and participant characteristics-were examined using mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models. Results: Over two and one-half years of follow-up, 143 participants reported 174 pregnancies. Approximately half showed changes in intention between the prospective and retrospective assessments, with 38% of participants reporting increased intendedness and 10% decreased intendedness. Reported intendedness increased more among those who gave birth (mean change in continuous LMUP score, 2.2) than among those who obtained an abortion (0.7), as well as among individuals with a college degree (4.1) than among those with a high school diploma (1.2). Participants who reported recent depression or anxiety symptoms showed more stable intentions (0.02) than those who did not (2.1). Conclusions: Retrospective measurement of pregnancy intentions may underestimate the frequency of unintended pregnancy, with such underestimation being greater among certain subgroups. Estimates based on retrospective reports thus may produce inaccurate impressions of intentionality. Further efforts to refine the measurement of pregnancy preferences are needed.","Affiliation 1 Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francisco.","Lauren J Ralph , Diana Greene Foster , Corinne H Rocca ",Perspect Sex Reprod Health,2020 Mar,"Comparative Study,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Abortion, Induced / statistics & numerical data,Adolescent,Adult,Female,Humans,Intention,Logistic Models,Longitudinal Studies,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, Unplanned*,Prospective Studies*,Refusal to Treat / statistics & numerical data,Reproducibility of Results,Reproductive Behavior / psychology*,Retrospective Studies*,United States / epidemiology,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32189427
16,A pilot feasibility study of a group-delivered cancer parenting program: Enhancing Connections-Group,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and short-term impact of a 5-session fully manualized, group-delivered cancer parenting education program to diagnosed parents or surrogate parents with a school-age child. Design: Single group, pre-post-test design with intent to treat analysis. Sample: A total of 16 parents completed the program who were diagnosed within 12 months with non-metastatic cancer of any type (Stages 0-III), read and wrote English, had a child 5-17 years old who knew the parent's diagnosis. Methods: Assessments occurred at baseline and at 2 months post-baseline on standardized measures of parental depressed mood, anxiety, parenting self-efficacy, parenting quality, parenting skills and child behavioral-emotional adjustment. Findings/results: The program was feasible and well accepted: 16/18 (89%) of the enrolled participants were included in the intent to treat analysis. Program staff were consistently positive and enthusiastic about the demonstrated skills they observed in group attendees during the group-delivered sessions, including the emergence of support between attendees. Outcomes on all measures improved between baseline and post-intervention; changes were statistically significant on measures of parents' anxiety, parents' self-efficacy, parents' skills, and parenting quality. Conclusions: The group-delivered Enhancing Connections cancer parenting program has potential to improve behavioral-emotional outcomes on standardized measures of skills and emotional adjustment in parents, parent-surrogates and children. Future testing is warranted.

17,Genotype-guided dietary supplementation in precision nutrition,"Achieving adequate micronutrient status, while avoiding deficiencies, represents a challenge for people globally. Consequently, many individuals resort to oral nutrient supplementation (ONS) in order to correct suboptimal dietary intakes. Advances in the fields of nutrigenetics and nutritional genomics have identified differences in response to micronutrient supplementation according to genetic makeup, adding dietary supplement use to the clinician's toolkit in the precision nutrition era. This review focuses on published evidence linking genetic variants to the responses associated with some of the most popular dietary supplements. With an increasing number of health professionals becoming involved in the prescription of ONS, identifying and matching individuals to the appropriate dietary supplement according to their genotype is important for achieving optimal health benefits and micronutrient equilibrium, while reducing the adverse events and financial costs often associated with excessive ONS.","Affiliations 1 Department of Biology, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. 2 Embiodiagnostics, Biology Research Company, Heraklion, Crete, Greece. 3 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, International Hellenic University, Thessaloniki, Greece. 4 Clinical Genomics and Pharmacogenomics Unit, 4th Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. 5 Center for New Biotechnologies and Precision Medicine, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. 6 Center of Basic Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece.","Kalliopi K Gkouskou , Maria G Grammatikopoulou , Ioannis Vlastos , Despina Sanoudou , Aristides G Eliopoulos ",Nutr Rev,2021 Oct 11,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Dietary Supplements*,Genotype,Humans,Micronutrients,Nutritional Status,Vitamins*,Micronutrients,Vitamins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33367884
18,Parental training in groups: a brief health promotion program,"Objective: To propose a brief parenting program offered in the context of health promotion and evaluate the immediate results relating to use of appropriate parenting practices and quality of parent-child interaction. Methods: Forty-five parents of school-age children from two non-governmental institutions located in a medium-sized city in the state of Sao Paulo participated in the study. The following assessment tools were used in the pre and post-tests: the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Quality of Family Interaction Scales (EQIFs), and the Brazilian Economic Classification Criteria (CCEB). Only scores of parents who attended 75% of the program were included in the analysis (25 participants). Results: Most of the participants who completed the program were grouped in socioeconomic levels B and C (72%) and the complaints reported in the pre-test centered on disobedience and stubbornness (29.6%, each). Regarding parents' perceptions of their educational practices and interaction with the children, improvements were detected in several of the aspects measured: affective relationship, involvement, model, communication, rules and monitoring, and children's feelings, besides reduction in use of physical punishment and negative marital atmosphere (p < 0.03). Reductions were detected in aggressive behavior (p = 0.02) and externalizing problems (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Despite the small sample and application in a specific community, this quick and affordable intervention seems to have yielded improvements in parent's monitoring and their affective relationships with their children, in addition to reductions in punishments and children's aggressive behavior, contributing to better parent-child interaction in the community.","Affiliation 1 Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brazil.","Marcella Cassiano Russo , Isabela Pizzarro Rebessi , Carmem Beatriz Neufeld ",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,2021 Jan-Mar,"Brazil,Health Promotion,Humans,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33681910

20,Monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancies,"Monoamniotic twin pregnancies are rare, but early diagnosis of such pregnancies is critical, as the incidence of complications in these pregnancies is much higher than in diamniotic or dichorionic twin pregnancies. Overall, only 70% of all monoamniotic twins will survive. Furthermore, approximately half of fetal deaths in these pregnancies are because of the high incidence of fetal anomalies (15%-25%), such as twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence and conjoined twinning. Therefore, early anatomy screening in the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended. Other causes of fetal death in these pregnancies include twin-twin transfusion syndrome, tight cord entanglement, or acute hemodynamic imbalances through the large placental vascular anastomoses. After viability, fetal surveillance can be intensified, as this decreases the risk of in utero death. Both inpatient and outpatient surveillance are reasonable. If otherwise uncomplicated, monoamniotic twins should be delivered at 33 to 34 weeks' gestation. Most centers will deliver by cesarean delivery, but some continue to advocate for vaginal delivery. Lastly, neonatal morbidity is high in monoamniotic twin pregnancies and is mainly related to prematurity.","Affiliations 1 Fetal Medicine Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Ontario Fetal Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

21,Sleeping with Hippocampal Damage,"The hippocampus plays a critical role in sleep-related memory processes [1-3], but it is unclear which specific sleep features are dependent upon this brain structure. The examination of sleep physiology in patients with focal bilateral hippocampal damage and amnesia could supply important evidence regarding these links. However, there is a dearth of such studies, despite these patients providing compelling insights into awake cognition [4, 5]. Here, we sought to identify the contribution of the hippocampus to the sleep phenotype by characterizing sleep via comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses in memory-impaired patients with selective bilateral hippocampal damage and matched control participants using in-home polysomnography on 4 nights. We found that, compared to control participants, patients had significantly reduced slow-wave sleep-likely due to decreased density of slow waves-as well as slow-wave activity. In contrast, slow and fast spindles were indistinguishable from those of control participants. Moreover, patients expressed slow oscillations (SOs), and SO-fast spindle coupling was observed. However, on closer scrutiny, we noted that the timing of spindles within the SO cycle was delayed in the patients. The shift of patients' spindles into the later phase of the up-state within the SO cycle may indicate a mismatch in timing across the SO-spindle-ripple events that are associated with memory consolidation [6, 7]. The substantial effect of selective bilateral hippocampal damage on large-scale oscillatory activity in the cortex suggests that, as with awake cognition, the hippocampus plays a significant role in sleep physiology, which may, in turn, be necessary for efficacious episodic memory.","Affiliations 1 Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London WC1N 3AR, UK. 2 Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen 6525 EN, the Netherlands. 3 Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Geriatric Psychiatry, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn 53127, Germany. 4 Department of Neurology, Royal Free Hospital, London NW3 2QG, UK. 5 Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK. 6 Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA. 7 Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London WC1N 3AR, UK.

22,"Painless cervical dilation with ""hourglass membranes"": conservative management","Background: Cervical competence is currently conceived as a continuous biological process with progressive degrees of insufficiency, this substituting the traditional vision of cervical competence as being present or absent. The most extreme expression of cervical insufficiency is known as ""hourglass membranes"". Currently no consensus exists regarding the treatment of pregnancies complicated by the protrusion of amniotic membranes; however, the majority of authors agree on recommending bed rest and performing cervical cerclage, known as ""emergent cerclage."" Methods: We describe a series of clinical cases corresponding to second-trimester pregnancies with cervical dilation and prolapsed amniotic membranes that were admitted to our hospital, managed with conservative treatment. All patients received the same basic treatment: intravenous fluid therapy for hydration, a single-oral-dose of azithromycin and intravenous antibiotic therapy for 7 days, vaginal micronized progesterone and indomethacin administrated orally. Results: Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 22.5 weeks with an extension of pregnancy between 2.1 and 16 weeks, with eight patients (72.72%) who extended their pregnancy for more than 8 weeks. In all cases, live fetuses were obtained, with favorable evolution. Conclusions: Despite our limited experience, resulting from the low number of cases presenting, our results encourage us to propose conservative management in pregnancies complicated with a dilated cervix and membranes protruding into the vagina, as a reasonable alternative to surgical emergency cervical cerclage, which is currently considered the therapy of choice when extreme cervical shortening occurs in the second trimester of pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Virgen Macarena Hospital, Seville, Spain - ifontanatal@hotmail.com. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Virgen Macarena Hospital, Seville, Spain. 3 Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Virgen Macarena Hospital, Seville, Spain.","Isabel M Fontán Atalaya , Andrea Caruso , Almudena Perea Cruz , Bartolomé Fernandez Torres ",Minerva Obstet Gynecol,2021 Oct,"Cerclage, Cervical*,Conservative Treatment,Dilatation,Female,Humans,Infant,Labor Stage, First,Pregnancy,Uterine Cervical Incompetence* / surgery",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33876896
23,Early pregnancy weight gain and fat accrual predict pregnancy outcome in growing adolescent sheep,"The competition for nutrients when pregnancy coincides with continuing growth in biologically immature adolescent girls increases their risk of preterm delivery and low birthweight and is partly replicated in the overnourished adolescent sheep paradigm. Although overfeeding to promote rapid maternal growth robustly leads to a reduction in average birthweight relative to slow-growing control-fed adolescents of equivalent age, the extent of prenatal compromise is variable. This retrospective analysis of a large cohort of identically managed pregnancies determined whether maternal anthropometry predicts the severity of fetal growth-restriction (FGR) in growing adolescents. Singleton pregnancies were established by embryo transfer in adolescents subsequently control-fed (n = 96) or overnourished. The latter pregnancies were classified as non-FGR (n = 116) or FGR (n = 96) if lamb birthweight was above or below the optimally fed control mean minus 2SD. A similar approach categorised placental growth-restriction (PlGR) and preterm delivery. Gestation length, placental mass and lamb birthweight were FGR < non-FGR < control (post hoc P < 0.01). Relative to the non-FGR group, overnourished dams with FGR were marginally leaner and lighter at conception (P = 0.023/P = 0.014) and had greater gestational weight gain (GWG) during the first-third of pregnancy (P < 0.001). GWG during this early period was also higher in PlGR compared with non-PlGR, and in very preterm vs term deliveries (P < 0.01). Likewise maternal leptin concentrations (fat accrual biomarker) were FGR > non-FGR by day 60, and changes in leptin throughout pregnancy predicted attenuated fetal cotyledon mass and birthweight (P = 0.01 to <0.001). The anthropometric antecedents of FGR in still-growing adolescent sheep originate in early pregnancy coincident with early placental development.","Affiliation 1 Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.","Jacqueline M Wallace , John S Milne , Raymond P Aitken ",Reproduction,2021 Mar,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Female,Fetal Growth Retardation / etiology,Gestational Weight Gain*,Placenta,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*,Retrospective Studies,Sheep,Sheep, Domestic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33275119

25,Smart alarm based on sleep stages prediction,"A sleep inertia after waking up strongly affects the overall mental recovery after sleep. The sleep inertia depends not as much on overall sleep quality but also on the sleep stage in the waking up moment. The fix-time alarming system results in waking up at random sleep stage, which results in frequent sleep inertia. The widely used flow-time alarming systems based on motion detection (actigraphy) reduce but do not eliminate sleep inertia. Such systems do not wake up users in Deep sleep stage, but may instead wake them up in Wake, Light, or REM (Rapid Eyes Movement) stages. Moreover, frequent waking up in the REM stage results in serious psychological issues. We present a smartwatch alarm system that predicts sleep stages and thus produces an alarm call at an easy waking up moment with minimal sleep inertia effect. The sleep stages are predicted using an Encoder-Decoder Recurrent Neural Network model. The rationale of the prediction is that each sleep stages cycling pattern is a continuous quasi-periodic process. Experimental results from over 138 nocturnal sleep periods from 92 respondents show that our system provides 66-70% accuracy for Deep, Light, Wake, REM sleep stages and 71-77% accuracy for 2-classes (Deep/REM vs. Light/Wake stages) prediction classifications.

26,Validating Claims-Based Algorithms Determining Pregnancy Outcomes and Gestational Age Using a Linked Claims-Electronic Medical Record Database,"Introduction: Pregnancy outcome identification and precise estimates of gestational age (GA) are critical in drug safety studies of pregnant women. Validated pregnancy outcome algorithms based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) have not previously been published. Methods: We developed algorithms to classify pregnancy outcomes and estimate GA using ICD-10-CM/PCS and service codes on claims in the 2016-2018 IBM® MarketScan® Explorys® Claims-EMR Data Set and compared the results with ob-gyn adjudication of electronic medical records (EMRs). Obstetric services were grouped into episodes using hierarchical and spacing requirements. GA was based on evidence with the highest clinical accuracy. Among pregnancies with obstetric EMRs, 100 full-term live births (FTBs), 100 preterm live births (PTBs), 100 spontaneous abortions (SAs), and 24 stillbirths were selected for review. Physicians adjudicated cases using Global Alignment of Immunization safety Assessment in pregnancy (GAIA) definitions applied to structured EMRs. Results: The claims-based algorithms identified 34,204 pregnancies, of which 9.9% had obstetric EMRs. Of sampled pregnancies, 92 FTBs, 93 PTBs, 75 SAs, and 24 stillbirths were adjudicated. Among these pregnancies, the percent agreement was 97.8%, 62.4%, 100.0%, and 70.8% for FTBs, PTBs, SAs, and stillbirths, respectively. The percent agreement on GA within 7 and 28 days, respectively, was 85.9% and 100.0% for FTBs, 81.7% and 98.9% for PTBs, 61.3% and 94.7% for SAs, and 66.7% and 79.2% for stillbirths. Conclusions: The pregnancy outcome algorithms had high agreement with physician adjudication of EMRs and may inform post-market maternal safety surveillance.","Affiliations 1 IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA, USA. kmoll@us.ibm.com. 2 Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA. 3 IBM Watson Health, Cambridge, MA, USA. 4 IBM Global Business Services, Bethesda, MD, USA. 5 University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. 6 Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.","Keran Moll , Hui Lee Wong , Kathryn Fingar , Shayan Hobbi , Minya Sheng , Timothy A Burrell , Linda O Eckert , Flor M Munoz , Bethany Baer , Azadeh Shoaibi , Steven Anderson ",Drug Saf,2021 Nov,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Abortion, Spontaneous*,Algorithms,Electronic Health Records,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome* / epidemiology,Stillbirth / epidemiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34591264
27,Event-related potentials in insomnia reflect altered perception of sleep,"Study objectives: Insomnia is defined by the subjective complaint of poor sleep as well as daytime impairments. Since polysomnography (PSG) typically shows only modest sleep impairment, some still unidentified property of sleep, not mirrored in PSG, may be modified in insomnia.One possible mechanistic hypothesis is that insomnia patients may be more sensitive to inevitably occurring internal or external stimuli during the night, causing brief sleep disruptions then perceived as wake time. Methods: Auditory event-related potentials (ERP) to low intensity (50 dB SPL) synthesized guitar tones played continuously throughout two nights of polysomnographically registered sleep were obtained in fifty patients with insomnia disorder (ID, without comorbidities) and 50 age- and sex-matched good sleeper controls (GSC) for each sleep stage and NREM/REM cycle. Phasic and tonic REM were treated as separate stages. Latencies and amplitudes of components P1, N1 and P2 were measured and analyzed by multivariate repeated-measures ANCOVA including effects of group, night, cycle, and age. Results: ID showed reduced P2 amplitudes relative to GSC specifically in phasic REM sleep. The same reduction also correlated with the amount of sleep misperception across groups. Independent component analysis showed a frontal negativity to contribute most to this group difference. Conclusions: The present finding can be interpreted as increased mismatch negativity (MMN) in ID, reflecting automated detection of change in the auditory system and a concomitant orienting response. Specifically phasic REM sleep appears to be vulnerable to sensory afferences in ID patients, possibly contributing to the perception of being awake.

28,Developmental features of sleep electrophysiology in family dogs,"Age-related differences in dog sleep and the age at which dogs reach adulthood as indexed by sleep electrophysiology are unknown. We assessed, in (1) a Juvenile sample (n = 60) of 2-14-month-old dogs (weight range: 4-68 kg), associations between age, sleep macrostructure, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) EEG power spectrum, whether weight moderates associations, and (2) an extended sample (n = 91) of 2-30-months-old dogs, when sleep parameters stabilise. In Juvenile dogs, age was positively associated with time in drowsiness between 2 and 8 months, and negatively with time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep between 2 and 6 months. Age was negatively associated with delta and positively with theta and alpha power activity, between 8 and 14 months. Older dogs exhibited greater sigma and beta power activity. Larger, > 8-month-old dogs had less delta and more alpha and beta activity. In extended sample, descriptive data suggest age-related power spectrum differences do not stabilise by 14 months. Drowsiness, REM, and delta power findings are consistent with prior results. Sleep electrophysiology is a promising index of dog neurodevelopment; some parameters stabilise in adolescence and some later than one year. Determination of the effect of weight and timing of power spectrum stabilisation needs further inquiry.

31,Induction of Labor versus Cesarean Delivery in Twin Pregnancies,"Objective: This study was aimed to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes between women with twin pregnancies who underwent induction of labor with those women who had planned Cesarean delivery (CD). Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study of women with twin pregnancies ≥ 24 weeks with an indication for delivery but not in labor. Two groups were examined, women who underwent induction and women who underwent planned CD. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between groups both for deliveries at gestational age ≥ 37 weeks and < 37 weeks. Results: A total of 453 patients were included. Overall, 212 (46.8%) women underwent induction and 241 (53.2%) underwent planned CD. Women who underwent induction of labor had a high rate of VD, both in the term and preterm groups (69.8 and 73.6%, respectively). Women who underwent induction of labor had reduced maternal length of stay, neonatal length of stay, and blood loss, without any increase in adverse outcomes. Neonatal ventilation of either twin delivered < 37 weeks was higher in the CD compared with induction group (27.5 vs. 9.4%, p < 0.01), but this was not significant on adjusted odds ratio analysis (aOR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.19-2.66).

32,Associations of the residential built environment with adolescent sleep outcomes,"Study objectives: Over 75% of US high school students obtain insufficient sleep, placing them at risk for adverse health outcomes. Identification of modifiable determinants of adolescent sleep is needed to inform prevention strategies, yet little is known about the influence of the built environment on adolescent sleep. Methods: In this prospective study, actigraphy was used to assess sleep outcomes among 110 adolescents for 14 days each in eighth and ninth grades: duration (hours/night), onset and offset, and sleeping ≥8 hours. Home addresses were linked to built environment exposures: sound levels, tree canopy cover, street density, intersection density, population density, and housing density. Mixed-effects regression estimated associations of built environment measures with sleep outcomes, adjusting for sex, race, parent education, household income, household size, grade, weeknight status, and neighborhood poverty. Results: A 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in neighborhood sound was associated with 16 minutes later sleep onset (β = 0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.49) and 25% lower odds of sleeping for ≥8 hours (odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.96). A 1-SD increase in neighborhood tree canopy was associated with 18 minutes earlier sleep onset (β = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.49, -0.13) and 10 minutes earlier sleep offset (β= -0.17, 95% CI: -0.28, -0.05). No associations were observed for density-based exposures. Conclusions: Higher neighborhood sound level was associated with lower odds of sufficient sleep, while higher tree canopy cover was associated with more favorable sleep timing.

However, how basic features of sleep, its depth and duration, contribute to this process remained elusive. Here, we investigated spatial object-place recognition (OPR) memory in rats, to systematically dissociate effects of sleep depth and duration on the formation of recent and remote hippocampus-dependent memory. Encoding of the spatial configuration was followed by an experimental post-encoding period of either 2 or 4 h, during which the rats had either ""regular sleep"", ""deeper sleep"", or were kept awake. A deeper sleep was achieved by an extended habituation of the rats to the sleep environment. Retrieval was tested either immediately after the 2-hour post-encoding period (recent memory test) or 1 week later (remote memory test). Deeper sleep expressed itself in a selective increase in the time spent in SWS, and in numbers of slow oscillations, spindles, and hippocampal ripples during SWS, whereas preREM and REM sleep were not affected. At the recent test, OPR memory was preserved only after sleep, but independent of its depth. At the remote test, however, OPR memory was preserved only after deeper sleep, whereas the wake and the regularly sleeping rats did not show remote OPR memory, even with the longer 4-h post-encoding period. Our results indicate that, rather than a longer duration, deeper sleep, i.e., a longer time in SWS together with enhanced oscillatory signatures of mnemonic processing during this sleep stage, occurring within a 2-hour window after encoding, is the factor that makes hippocampus-dependent memory more persistent.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Germany. 2 Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Germany; Graduate School of Neural & Behavioural Science, International Max Planck Research School, Tübingen, Germany. 3 Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases of the Helmholtz Center Munich at the University of Tübingen (IDM), Tübingen, Germany; Center for Integrative Neuroscience, University of Tübingen, Germany. 4 Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Germany.

34,Marriage-based pilot clean household fuel intervention in India for improved pregnancy outcomes,"Introduction: Health interventions often target pregnant women and their unborn children. Interventions in rural India targeting pregnant women, however, often do not cover the critical early windows of susceptibility during the first trimester and parts of the second trimester. This pilot seeks to determine if targeting newlyweds could protect entire pregnancies with a clean stove and fuel intervention. Methods: We recruited 50 newlywed couples who use biomass as a cooking fuel into a clean cooking intervention that included a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove, two gas cylinders, a table to place the stove on and health education. We first evaluated whether community health workers in this region could identify and recruit couples at marriage. We quantified how many additional days of pregnancy could be covered by an intervention if we recruited at marriage versus recruiting after detection of pregnancy. Results: On average, we identified and visited newlywed couples within 40 (SD 21) days of marriage. Of the 50 couples recruited, 25 pregnancies and 18 deliveries were identified during this 1-year study. Due to challenges securing fuel from the LPG supply system, not all couples received their intervention prior to pregnancy. Regardless, couples recruited in the marriage arm had substantially more days with the intervention than couples recruited into a similar arm recruited at pregnancy (211 SD 46 vs 120 SD 45). At scale, a stove intervention targeting new marriages would cover about twice as many weeks of first pregnancies as an intervention recruiting after detection of pregnancy. Conclusions: We were able to recruit in early marriage using existing community health workers. Households recruited early in marriage had more days with clean fuel coverage than those recruited at pregnancy. Our findings indicate that recruitment at marriage is feasible and warrants further exploration for stove and other interventions targeting pregnancy-related outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Atlanta, Georgia, USA ajaypillarisetti@gmail.com. 2 Vadu Rural Health Program, KEM Hospital Research Centre, Pune, India. 3 University of California, San Francisco, California, USA. 4 ICMR Center for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health, Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Faculty of Public Health, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. 5 Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA. 6 Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, Maharashtra, India. 7 Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.","Ajay Pillarisetti , Sudipto Roy , Nadia Diamond-Smith , Makarand Ghorpade , Arun Dhongade , Kalpana Balakrishnan , Sankar Sambandam , Rutuja Patil , David I Levine , Sanjay Juvekar , Kirk R Smith ",BMJ Open,2020 Oct 5,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Air Pollution, Indoor*,Child,Cooking,Female,Household Articles*,Humans,India,Marriage,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33020110
35,Correlation of perinatal outcomes with amniotic fluid assessment techniques in high-risk pregnancies in a Tertiary Hospital in Southern Nigeria,"Background: Oligohydramnios is a predictor of fetal compromise and a useful tool in pregnancy management. It has been assessed using various techniques, including two-diameter pocket (2-DP) and amniotic fluid index (AFI). Objectives: To determine which of these two techniques best diagnose oligohydramnios and predicts adverse perinatal outcomes. Methods: This was a comparative cross-sectional study conducted at Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara in southern region of Nigeria over eight months period. One hundred high-risk pregnant women were recruited and ultrasound determination of amniotic fluid was performed using AFI and 2-DP. The women were followed up till delivery to determine adverse perinatal outcomes. Results: The indices of validity of AFI and the 2-DP were calculated and compared. The 2-DP had a higher sensitivity than AFI for adverse outcomes in high-risk pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios. Conclusion: The 2-DP technique should preferably be used for the assessment of oligohydramnios in high-risk pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust, Obstetrics and Gynecology Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Clinical Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria. 3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara, Nigeria.","Ovoke Egagifo , Lawrence O Omo-Aghoja , Ayotunde T Adeyinka ",Afr Health Sci,2021 Sep,"Amniotic Fluid* / diagnostic imaging,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Nigeria,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, High-Risk*,Tertiary Care Centers,Ultrasonography, Prenatal / methods",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35222596
36,Cyclic alternating pattern in obstructive sleep apnea: A preliminary study,"Obstructive sleep apnea is linked to cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders and dementia. The precise nature of the association between respiratory events in obstructive sleep apnea, cortical or subcortical arousals, and cognitive, autonomic and oxidative stress consequences remains incompletely elucidated. Previous studies have aimed to understand the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and arousal patterns, as defined by the cyclic alternating pattern, but results have been inconsistent, in part likely due to the presence of associated comorbidities. To better define this relationship, we analysed cyclic alternating patterns in patients with obstructive sleep apnea without any additional comorbidities. We identified 18 adult male, non-obese subjects with obstructive sleep apnea and no other comorbidities or medication history, who underwent whole-night electroencephalography and polysomnography. Cyclic alternating pattern analysis was performed and verified by certified somnologists. Pairwise linear regression analysis demonstrated an inverse relationship between obstructive sleep apnea severity and cyclic alternating pattern subtype A1, and a direct correlation with cyclic alternating pattern subtype A3. Cyclic alternating pattern subtypes A1 prevail in milder obstructive sleep apnea phenotype, whilst cyclic alternating pattern subtypes A2 and A3 overcome among moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea patients. The milder obstructive sleep apnea group also presented higher sleep efficiency, and increased percentages of non-rapid eye movement stage 3 and rapid eye movement sleep, as well as longer cyclic alternating pattern sequences in N3, while severe obstructive sleep apnea patients spent more time in lighter sleep stages. These results imply/suggest a balance between cyclic alternating pattern's adaptive and maladaptive arousal processes in obstructive sleep apnea of differing severities. In milder obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index < 20), sleep continuity may be reinforced by cyclic alternating pattern subtype A1, whereas in more severe obstructive sleep apnea, decompensation of these sleep-stabilizing mechanisms may occur and more intrusive cyclic alternating pattern fluctuations disrupt sleep circuitry.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neuroimaging, Sleep and Brain Plasticity Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, UK. 2 Sleep Disorders Centre, Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. 3 Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, UK. 4 Neurology Unit, Department of General Medicine, Parma University Hospital, Parma, Italy. 5 National Institute of Clinical Neuroscience, Budapest, Hungary. 6 NIHR-Wellcome Trust King's Clinical Research Facility, King's College London, London, UK. 7 Department of Neurology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.","Valentina Gnoni , Panagis Drakatos , Sean Higgins , Iain Duncan , Danielle Wasserman , Renata Kabiljo , Carlotta Mutti , Peter Halasz , Peter J Goadsby , Guy D Leschziner , Ivana Rosenzweig ",J Sleep Res,2021 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Humans,Male,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Apnea, Obstructive* / epidemiology,Sleep Stages,Sleep, REM",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33939202
37,Comparisons of pregnancy outcomes between twin pregnancies with and without second-trimester amniocentesis,"Objective: To assess the amniocentesis-related pregnancy loss rate and preterm birth rate among twin pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary center. The study group included twin pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis during 16 to 22 weeks of gestation. The control group was those not undergoing amniocentesis. All amniocenteses were performed by the MFM specialists. The main outcomes were the rate of pregnancy loss (before 24 weeks) and preterm birth. Results: A total of 332 cases in the study group and 1188 controls were analyzed. The percentages of maternal age ≥35 years, high parity, and cases complicated with medical diseases were significantly higher in the study group. The pregnancy loss rate after the procedure tended to be higher, but not significant, in the study group (3.0% vs 2.2% P = .383). Likewise, the rate of preterm birth in the study group was higher, but not significant (70.5% vs 66.0% P = .130). Logistic regression analysis to adjust confounding factors showed no significance of amniocentesis on pregnancy loss and preterm birth. Conclusion: Though amniocentesis in twin pregnancies has theoretical risk of pregnancy loss, it is relatively safe when performed by maternal-fetal medicine specialists. This information is useful for counseling, especially when performed by experienced hands.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.","Rangsan Dechnunthapiphat , Ratanaporn Sekararithi , Theera Tongsong , Chanane Wanapirak , Wirawit Piyamongkol , Supatra Sirichotiyakul , Fuanglada Tongprasert , Kasemsri Srisupundit , Suchaya Luewan , Phudit Jatavan , Kuntharee Traisrisilp ",Prenat Diagn,2020 Sep,"Comparative Study,Abortion, Spontaneous / epidemiology,Abortion, Spontaneous / etiology,Adult,Amniocentesis* / adverse effects,Amniocentesis* / statistics & numerical data,Case-Control Studies,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology*,Pregnancy Trimester, Second,Pregnancy, Twin / statistics & numerical data*,Premature Birth / epidemiology,Premature Birth / etiology,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Thailand / epidemiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32639028
38,Elucidation of Neural Circuits Involved in the Regulation of Sleep/Wakefulness Using Optogenetics,"Although sleep is an absolutely essential physiological phenomenon for maintaining normal health in animals, little is known about its function to date. In this section, I introduce the application of optogenetics to freely behaving animals for the purpose of characterizing neural circuits involved in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness. Applying optogenetics to the specific neurons involved in sleep/wakefulness regulation enabled the precise control of the sleep/wakefulness states between wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and REM sleep states. For example, selective activation of orexin neurons using channelrhodopsin-2 and melanopsin induced a transition from sleep to wakefulness. In contrast, suppression of these neurons using halorhodopsin and archaerhodopsin induced a transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep and increased the time spent in NREM sleep. Selective activation of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons induced a transition from NREM sleep to REM sleep and prolonged the time spent in REM sleep, which was accompanied by a decrease in NREM sleep time. Optogenetics was first introduced to orexin neurons in 2007 and has since rapidly spread throughout the field of neuroscience. In the last 13 years or so, neural nuclei and the cell types that control sleep/wakefulness have been identified. The use of optogenetic studies has greatly contributed to the elucidation of the neural circuits involved in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness.","Affiliations 1 Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. tsune@tohoku.ac.jp. 2 Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. tsune@tohoku.ac.jp. 3 JST, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Japan. tsune@tohoku.ac.jp.",Tomomi Tsunematsu ,Adv Exp Med Biol,2021,"Animals,Neurons,Optogenetics*,Sleep,Sleep, REM,Wakefulness*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33398828
39,Functional development of preterm children born from singleton and multiple pregnancies: Preliminary study,"Background: In recent years an increasing number of multiple pregnancies have been observed, which is a result of advancements made in reproductive technologies for infertility treatments as well as a tendency for women to delay childbearing until later in life. The risk of preterm birth in the case of a twin pregnancy is five to seven times higher than that of a singleton pregnancy, and in the case of triplet pregnancy, the risk is even 10 times higher. The objective of the study was to assess and compare the functional development of children aged between 2 and 2.5 who were prematurely born from singleton, twin and triplet pregnancies. Material and methods: The study was carried out in a group of 43 children aged between 2 and 2.5 who were born prematurely (between the 32nd and 36th week of pregnancy) in 2017 and 2018. Group I was made up of 10 children born from singleton pregnancies, group II included 12 children born from six twin pregnancies and group III consisted of 21 children born from seven triplet pregnancies. The evaluation of functional development was conducted using the Munich Functional Developmental Diagnostics. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in functional development between the studied singletons, twins and triplets. In the examined groups of singletons, twins and triplets, the calculated quotient medians for the 50th percentile approximated 1, which means that development was typical and did not differ from the development of the general population. In turn, for the 95th percentile, the median scores usually approximated 0.8, which also indicated that there was no significant delay in development. Had scores been higher than 1, this might have indicated a delay. Conclusions: On the basis of the study group, no relationship was found between the multiplicity of pregnancies and the functional development of premature babies born between the 32nd and 36th weeks of gestation.","Affiliations 1 Clinical Department of Neonatology, University Hospital in Cracow, postgraduate student at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Jagiellonian University Medical College Cracow Poland. 2 Institute of Nursing and Midwifery, Faculty of Health Sciences, Jagiellonian University Medical College Cracow Poland. 3 Clinical Department of Neonatology, University Hospital in Cracow Cracow Poland.","Aneta M Suder , Agnieszka J Gniadek , Agnieszka M Micek , Dorota W Pawlik ",J Mother Child,2021 Oct 11,"Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Infant, Low Birth Weight,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*,Pregnancy, Twin,Premature Birth* / epidemiology,Triplets",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34643351

This article aimed to determine the prevalence of teenage pregnancy and to understand the association between social influences, self-efficacy, and communication about teenage pregnancies, among high school students in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Grade 11 students at 20 randomly selected schools in two districts completed an anonymous questionnaire on sociodemographics, social influences, self-efficacy communication, and teenage pregnancy. Teenage pregnancy was associated with age, being female, and exposure to communication discouraging pregnancy. Students living with both parents, or where family and peers believed that the adolescents should abstain from sex, or who experienced positive social pressure discouraging pregnancy were unlikely to have had a pregnancy. This study identified sociodemographic and sociobehavioral influences associated with teenage pregnancy that can assist school nurses in their work.","Affiliation 1 Discipline of Public Health Medicine, School of Nursing and Public Health, College of Health Sciences, 56394University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.","Saloshni Naidoo , Myra Taylor ",J Sch Nurs,2021 Apr,"Adolescent,Communication,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy in Adolescence*,Schools,Self Efficacy,Sex Education,Sexual Behavior,South Africa / epidemiology,Students",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31179820

44,Obstetric morbidity in gestational carrier pregnancies: a population-based study,"Purpose: We sought to characterize severe obstetric morbidity among women who are gestational carriers compared to other patients. Methods: This was a population-based study comparing gestational carrier pregnancies to non-surrogate pregnancies (non-surrogate IVF pregnancies, all non-gestational carrier pregnancies, and a cohort of matched controls) delivering in Utah between 2009 and 2018, using birth certificate data. Our primary outcome was a composite of severe morbidity, including death, ICU admission, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, transfusion, and unplanned hysterectomy. Our secondary outcomes were cesarean delivery (CD) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Results: During the study period, 361 gestational carrier pregnancies and 509,015 other pregnancies resulted in live births. Severe morbidity was less common among gestational carrier pregnancies than IVF pregnancies (1.7% versus 5.5%, odds ratio [OR] 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.70), but was not different when compared to all other pregnancies (1.0%, OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.72-3.60), or a cohort of matched controls (1.0%, OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.55-3.40). CD was less common among gestational carrier pregnancies than IVF pregnancies, but not different than all other pregnancies or matched controls. While frequency of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was lower among gestational carrier pregnancies than IVF pregnancies, it was higher than all other women who delivered and comparable to matched controls. Conclusion: Severe obstetric morbidity is uncommon among gestational carrier pregnancies. Women who are gestational carriers are at lower risk of morbidity and CD than others who conceive through IVF and do not appear to be at increased risk compared to matched controls.","Affiliations 1 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. katherine.swanson@ucsf.edu. 2 Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. katherine.swanson@ucsf.edu. 3 University of Utah Center for Reproductive Medicine, 675 Arapeen Way, Salt Lake City, UT, 84108, USA. 4 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, University of California San Francisco, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. 5 Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA. 6 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Utah Health, 50 N Medical Dr, Salt Lake City, UT, 84132, USA.","Kate Swanson , Joseph M Letourneau , Miriam Kuppermann , Brett D Einerson ",J Assist Reprod Genet,2021 Jan,"Adult,Cesarean Section,Female,Fertilization in Vitro*,Gestational Age,Humans,Morbidity*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / epidemiology*,Pregnancy Complications / genetics,Pregnancy Complications / physiopathology,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Pregnancy Outcome / genetics,Surrogate Mothers,Utah / epidemiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33145724
45,Parenting experiences of Chinese mothers living with a mental illness,"Background: Although the experiences of mothers with mental illness are well researched in Western countries, little is known about the experiences of Chinese mothers. This study aims to explore the experiences of family life and parenting of Chinese mothers, in the context of their mental illness. Methods: Fourteen Chinese mothers with mental illness undertook in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was employed to guide the data analysis. Results: Seven themes were identified: motherhood as a central identity, the stigma associated with being a mother with mental illness, participants' perceptions about the impact of mental illness on parenting and their children, experiences of talking to children about mental illness, how having children impacts mothers' illness and recovery, and support obtained and needed. Similar to Western mothers, Chinese mothers experienced stigma and fluctuating mental illness symptoms which impacted on parenting. Unlike mothers based in Western countries, the mothers interviewed in this study highlighted complicated co-caring relationships with parents-in-law and did not raise child custody concerns. Conclusions: Mental health professionals need to have the skills to identify and recognize the mothering role of their clients. Culturally sensitive interventions are required to assist Chinese families where mothers have a mental illness. Future research is required to investigate family experiences of parental mental illness from the perspectives of children, partners, and mental health professionals.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, VIC, 3800, Australia. lingling.chen@monash.edu. 2 Faculty of Education, Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, VIC, 3800, Australia. 3 Peking University Sixth Hospital, Peking University Institute of Mental Health, NHC Key Laboratory of Mental Health (Peking University), National Clinical Research Centre for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), Beijing, China.","Lingling Chen , Kitty Vivekananda , Lili Guan , Andrea Reupert ",BMC Psychiatry,2021 Nov 23,"Child,China,Female,Humans,Mental Disorders*,Mothers*,Parenting,Parents,Qualitative Research",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34814877

Results: The search included 944 studies, 15 of which were eligible for inclusion, representing 726 patients treated with cervical cerclage and 8578 non-cerclage treatment controls. When the cervical length was <15 mm, the risk ratio of preterm birth at <37 weeks (0.77, p = 0.01), <34 weeks (0.58, p = 0.002), and <32 weeks (0.61, p = 0.024) of gestation in the cerclage group was significantly lower than that in the non-cerclage group. Conclusion: For twin pregnancies with a cervical length <15 mm, cervical cerclage was associated with significant reduction in preterm birth.","Affiliations 1 West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Chengdu, 610041, China. 2 West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Chengdu, 610041, China; West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Key Laboratory of Obstetrics and Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Chengdu, 610041, China. 3 West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Chengdu, 610041, China; West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, Key Laboratory of Obstetrics and Gynecologic and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Chengdu, 610041, China.

However, such association during sleep was still unclear. The aim of the present work was to further investigate this association according to an activation-interaction association network. This study included 24 healthy individuals and all of them underwent overnight polysomnography. The absolute spectral powers of three frequency bands and the phase transfer entropy were extracted from six electroencephalogram channels. For each frequency band and sleep stage, activation-interaction association networks were built and correlation analysis was conducted by using Pearson correlation test. Results revealed the evident association between features derived from the two approaches during sleep, and as the sleep deepened, these correlation values attenuated in the alpha band, whereas the inversion happened in the delta band.

Results: Older individuals showed lower EEG connectivity in stage N2 but higher connectivity in REM and stage N3 compared to the younger cohort. Age-related differences in N3 were driven by the first sleep cycle. EEG connectivity was lower in REM than N3, especially in younger individuals. Exploratory analyses, controlling for the effects of age, indicated that higher EEG connectivity in delta during N2 was associated with higher processing speed, whereas, during REM sleep, lower EEG connectivity in delta and sigma was associated with higher verbal memory performance and a higher global averaged intelligence quotient score. Conclusion: Our results indicated that age modifies sleep EEG connectivity but the direction and the magnitude of these effects differ between sleep stages and cycles. Results in N3 and REM point to a reduced ability of the older brains to disconnect as compared to the younger ones. Our results also support the notion that cerebral functional connectivity during sleep may be associated with cognitive functions.","Affiliations 1 Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada. 2 Deparment of Psychology, Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada. 3 Department of Electrical Engineering, École de Technologie Supérieure, Montreal, QC, Canada.","Maude Bouchard , Jean-Marc Lina , Pierre-Olivier Gaudreault , Jonathan Dubé , Nadia Gosselin , Julie Carrier ",Sleep,2020 Mar 12,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Brain,Electroencephalography*,Female,Humans,Sleep Stages,Sleep*,Sleep, REM,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31691825
50,Western herbal medicines in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Western herbal medicines in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Design: A computer-based search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, GreenFILE, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and the Cochrane Library was conducted. A hand-search of the bibliographies of relevant papers and previous meta-analyses and reviews was also undertaken. Trials were included in the review if they were double-blind and placebo-controlled investigating the effects of Western herbal medicines on IBS-related symptoms or quality of life. There were no language restrictions. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. For herbal medicines where there was more than 1 trial of similar design, data were synthesised using relative risk of symptoms improving using the random effects model. Results: Thirty-three trials were identified that met all eligibility criteria. Seventeen of these evaluated peppermint essential oil, fifteen other Western herbal medicines, and one trial evaluated peppermint oil in one arm and aniseed essential oil in the other arm. Eighteen different herbal preparations were evaluated in these trials. Data suggests that a number of Western herbal medicines may provide relief of IBS symptoms. Meta-analyses suggest that peppermint essential oil is both efficacious and well-tolerated in the short-term management of IBS. Aloe vera and asafoetida also demonstrated efficacy in reducing global IBS symptoms in meta-analyses. The herbal formulas STW 5, STW 5-II and Carmint, along with Ferula assa-foetida, Pimpenella anisum oil, the combination of Curcumin and Foeniculum vulgare oil, and the blend of Schinopsis lorentzii, Aesculus hippocastanum, and peppermint essential oil also demonstrated efficacy in rigorously-designed clinical trials. Conclusion: A number of Western herbal medicines show promise in the treatment of IBS. With the exception of peppermint essential oil, Aloe vera, and asafoetida, however, none of the positive trials have been replicated. This lack of replication limits the capacity to make definitive statements of efficacy for these herbal medicines.","Affiliations 1 College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia; Australian Research Centre for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia.

51,Can herbal medicinal products or preparations alleviate neuropathic pain in adults? A Cochrane Review summary with commentary,"Background: Several medicines have been shown to be effective in treating neuropathic pain, but they can have damaging side effects, therefore people are now trying herbal products to help relieve pain. Objective: The aim of the Cochrane Review was to evaluate whether herbal products/preparations have an analgesic effectiveness in neuropathic pain and whether any side effects are associated with their use. Methods: The population addressed were adults aged ≥18 years, suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. Studies that investigated the effects of herbal products/preparations for the relief of neuropathic pain compared to any or no interventions were included. Results: Included studies did not show that herbal products/preparations have reduced pain intensity of 30% or above and there was no observable reduction in the total pain score. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to suggest that herbal products/preparations have any efficacy in any neuropathic pain conditions. The current evidence is of very low quality resulting in serious uncertainties about the estimates of effect observed.","Affiliation 1 IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, Milan, Italy.",Chiara Arienti ,NeuroRehabilitation,2021,"Review,Adult,Aged,Analgesics / isolation & purification,Analgesics / therapeutic use*,Female,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Herbal Medicine / trends,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Neuralgia / diagnosis*,Neuralgia / drug therapy*,Neuralgia / epidemiology,Plant Preparations / isolation & purification,Plant Preparations / therapeutic use*,Analgesics,Plant Preparations",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33386827
52,Parenting stress in parents of children with developmental coordination disorder,"Background: Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which affects around 5% of children but is often not detected by clinicians. Aims: The aim of the current study was to investigate whether parents of children with DCD report clinically-significant levels of parenting stress, and to assess a number of factors contributing to this stress, based on evidence from research into other neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods and procedures: A survey was completed by 174 parents of children aged 5-12 years with DCD (parents age M = 42;3, SD = 4;11), comprising measures of the child's motor difficulties and behavioural problems, the parent's perceived competence in the parenting role and perceived levels of social support, and parenting stress. Outcomes and results: Two thirds of parents reported clinically-significant levels of stress. Multiple regression analyses revealed that all variables except for level of motor difficulties were unique predictors of parenting stress. Conclusions and implications: The study highlights the need for greater awareness of DCD by bringing attention to the impact it can have on the whole family. Providing targeted interventions, particularly addressing parents' perceived competence in managing their child, could reduce parenting stress and improve parents' wellbeing. This in turn could influence their parenting and, therefore, child outcomes.","Affiliations 1 School of Psychology, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK. 2 School of Psychology, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK.

53,Refining the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) in Chinese Parents,"The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) is a popular brief assessment of parenting stress. However, its latent structure and psychometric properties have not been extensively addressed, in particular in non-Western cultures. The present study is the first to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the PSI-SF in parents from Mainland China (683 mother-father dyads; mean age of mothers = 37.10 years, SD = 3.68; mean age of fathers = 39.81 years, SD = 4.13). Initial analyses revealed that previously proposed factor structure of the PSI-SF did not fit the data well. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were then conducted to develop a psychometrically sound and efficient abbreviated version of the PSI-SF. In this new version of 15 items (PSI-SF-15), there are three factors (i.e., parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child). This abbreviated scale showed strict measurement invariance across sex of parent and satisfactory internal consistency. The convergent validity of the PSI-SF-15 were supported by its expected relations with the original PSF-SF measures, the multitrait-multimethod procedure, and its expected relations with scores on parenting behavior, parental depressiveness, and children's conduct problems. In conclusion, these results suggest that the PSI-SF-15 is a valid measure of parenting stress in Chinese parents, and that it holds promise as an informative and reliable alternative to the original PSI-SF when administration time is limited.","Affiliations 1 Inner Mongolia Normal University, Inner Mongolia, China. 2 Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, China. 3 Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China. 4 City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY, USA.","Jie Luo , Meng-Cheng Wang , Yu Gao , Hong Zeng , Wendeng Yang , Wei Chen , Shouying Zhao , Shisan Qi ",Assessment,2021 Mar,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,China,Female,Humans,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents,Stress, Psychological*,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31072108
54,Herbal medicines in functional dyspepsia-Untapped opportunities not without risks,"Background: Contemporary treatments for functional dyspepsia have limitations. Herbal medicine has been suggested as adjunctive treatment. With growing scientific recognition and public interests, an in-depth review of this is timely. Aims/purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic potential and problems that may be associated with the adoption of herbal medicines in functional dyspepsia. Methods: We reviewed the treatment landscape of functional dyspepsia and assessed the scientific community's interest in herbal medicine. Preclinical pharmacological and clinical trial data were reviewed for several herbal medicines available in the market. Challenges associated with adoption of herbal medicine in mainstream medicine were critically evaluated. Results: We found that herbal medicines frequently comprise a combination of herbs with multiple reported pharmacological effects on gastrointestinal motility and secretory functions, as well as cytoprotective and psychotropic properties. We identified a number of commercially available herbal products that have undergone rigorous clinical trials, involving large numbers of well-defined subjects, reporting both efficacy and safety for functional dyspepsia. Persisting concerns include lack of rigorous assessments for majority of products, toxicity, consistency of ingredients, dose standardizations, and quality control. We provide a quality framework for its evaluation. Conclusions: We commend herbal medicine as a viable future option in managing functional dyspepsia. An attractive appeal of herbal medicine is the prospect to simultaneously target multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. Wider adoption and acceptance of herbal medicines in treatment algorithms of functional dyspepsia will require the application of the scientific rigor expected of chemical therapies, to all stages of their development and evaluation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore and Gleneagles Hospital, Singapore City, Singapore. 2 Faculty of Medicine & Faculty of Health & Behavioural Sciences, University of Queensland and Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia. 3 Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. 4 Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. 5 Gastroenterology Department, Wuhan Union Hospital, Huazhong Science & Technology University, Wuhan, China. 6 Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. 7 Division of Gastroenterology, Wuhan Union Hospital, Huazhong Science & Technology University, Wuhan, China. 8 Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, and Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 9 Independent Researcher, Stomach, Liver & Bowel Centre, Gleneagles Hospital, Singapore City, Singapore. 10 Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.","Kok-Ann Gwee , Gerald Holtmann , Jan Tack , Hidekazu Suzuki , Jinsong Liu , Yinglian Xiao , Min-Hu Chen , Xiaohua Hou , Deng-Chyang Wu , Clarissa Toh , Fang Lu , Xu-Dong Tang ",Neurogastroenterol Motil,2021 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Gastrointestinal Diseases / drug therapy*,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Phytotherapy / methods*,Plant Preparations / therapeutic use*,Plant Preparations",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258198
55,Contributions of post-learning REM and NREM sleep to memory retrieval,"It has become clear that sleep after learning has beneficial effects on the later retrieval of newly acquired memories. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are becoming increasingly clear as well, particularly those of non-REM sleep. However, much is still unknown about the sleep and memory relationship: the sleep state or features of sleep physiology that associate with memory performance often vary by task or experimental design, and the nature of this variability is not entirely clear. This paper describes pertinent features of sleep physiology and provides a detailed review of the scientific literature indicating beneficial effects of post-learning sleep on memory retrieval. This paper additionally introduces a hypothesis which attributes these beneficial effects of post-learning sleep to separable processes of memory reinforcement and memory refinement whereby reinforcement supports one's ability to retrieve a given memory and refinement supports the precision of that memory retrieval in the context of competitive alternatives. It is observed that features of non-REM sleep are involved in a post-learning substantiation of memory representations that benefit memory performance; thus, memory reinforcement is primarily attributed to non-REM sleep. Memory refinement is primarily attributed to REM sleep given evidence of bidirectional synaptic plasticity in REM sleep and findings from studies of selective REM sleep deprivation.","Affiliations 1 Brock University, Canada. 2 Brock University, Canada.

56,Management of Twin Pregnancies: A Comparative Review of National and International Guidelines,"Importance: Twin pregnancies are associated with a higher risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity compared with singleton and require more intensive prenatal care. Objective: The aim of this study was to review and compare the recommendations from published guidelines on twin pregnancies. Evidence acquisition: A descriptive review of guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on the management of twin pregnancies was conducted. Results: All the guidelines highlight the importance of an accurate assessment of chorionicity, amnionicity, and gestational age in the first trimester. They also recommend the performance of nuchal translucency and a detailed anomaly scan. The ultrasound surveillance protocol is similar in all guidelines, that is, every 2 weeks for monochorionic and every 4 weeks for dichorionic twins. On the other hand, there are differences regarding the timing and mode of delivery, especially in monochorionic diamniotic twins, in the definition and management of fetal growth discordance, the use of cervical length to screen for preterm birth, and the timing of corticosteroids' administration. Conclusions: The differences in the reviewed guidelines on the management of twin pregnancies highlight the need for an adoption of an international consensus, in order to improve perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Resident Assistant. 2 Professor. 3 Assistant Professor, Third Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.","Ioannis Tsakiridis , Sonia Giouleka , Apostolos Mamopoulos , Apostolos Athanasiadis , Themistoklis Dagklis ",Obstet Gynecol Surv,2020 Jul,"Review,Delivery, Obstetric,Female,Fetal Diseases / diagnosis,Gestational Age,Humans,Practice Guidelines as Topic*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin*,Prenatal Care / methods*,Societies,Ultrasonography, Prenatal / methods",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32735684
57,Systematic review: fetal death reporting and risk in Zika-affected pregnancies,"Objectives: Zika virus is linked to several adverse pregnancy outcomes. We assessed whether Zika infection during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of foetal death (miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion) and whether there is incomplete reporting of such deaths. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and LILACS for studies reporting Zika-affected completed pregnancies (ending in foetal death or live birth), excluding studies whose aim required live birth. Studies 'allowed' foetal death if their populations were defined to encompass both live births and foetal deaths, regardless of whether deaths were actually found. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Foetal death absolute and relative risks in Zika-affected vs. unaffected pregnancies were calculated. Results: We found 108 reports including 24 699 completed, Zika-affected pregnancies. The median absolute risk in 37 studies of completed, Zika-affected pregnancies was 6.3% (IQR 3.2%, 10.6%) for foetal death and 5.9% (IQR 0%, 29.1%) for non-fatal adverse outcomes (e.g. microcephaly). More studies allowed non-fatal adverse outcomes (95%) than foetal death (58%). Of studies which allowed them, 94% found at least one foetal death. In 37% of reports, it was unknown whether foetal deaths were allowed. Only one study had sufficient data to estimate a foetal death relative risk (11.05, 95% CI 3.43, 35.55). Conclusions: Evidence was insufficient to determine whether foetal death risk is higher in Zika-affected pregnancies, but suggests quality of foetal death reporting should be improved, including stating whether foetal deaths were found, how many, and at what gestational ages, or justifying their exclusion.","Affiliations 1 Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. 2 University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. 3 Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. 4 Stillbirth Centre of Research Excellence, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.","Susannah Hopkins Leisher , Arin A Balalian , Hanna Reinebrant , Stephanie Shiau , Vicki Flenady , Louise Kuhn , Stephen S Morse ",Trop Med Int Health,2021 Feb,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Systematic Review,Abortion, Spontaneous / epidemiology,Abortion, Spontaneous / virology,Female,Humans,Microcephaly / epidemiology,Microcephaly / virology,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications, Infectious / epidemiology*,Pregnancy Complications, Infectious / virology,Pregnancy Outcome,Stillbirth / epidemiology*,Zika Virus Infection / epidemiology*,Zika Virus Infection / virology,Zika Virus*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164278
58,Spontaneous pregnancy versus assisted reproductive technologies: implications on maternal mental health,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major depressive disorder that affects women during the perinatal period. Our study aimed to evaluate the onset of psychological effects in spontaneous pregnancies in contrast with pregnancies resulting from in vitro fertilization (IVF). We carried out a prospective cohort study using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to evaluate postpartum depression. Patients were divided into 3 different groups based on their conception method: group A included spontaneous pregnancies, group B included pregnancies after homologous IVF, and group C pregnancies after heterologous IVF. The study included 245 patients. In the first year postpartum the incidence of psychological disorders was different exclusively at discharge from hospital (24.8% A vs. 38.7 B vs. 19% C) [P < .05] and one year after childbirth (13.3% A vs. 3.4% B vs. 4.8% C) [P < .05]. The multifactorial analysis showed a significant positive association between psychological distress and advanced maternal age, low parental education, nulliparity, preterm delivery and low fetal weight at birth, multiple pregnancies and multiple births, low pain threshold, and high rate of requesting analgesia intrapartum [P < .05]. Our results suggest a high correlation between PPD and pregnancies resulting from homologous IVF at the time of discharge, whereas there is a higher chance that spontaneous pregnancies develop postpartum depression one year after delivery.","Affiliations 1 IVIRMA, IVI Foundation, Avenida Fernando Abril Martorell, Valencia, Spain. 2 Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. 3 Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain. 4 University of Siena, Siena, Italy. 5 Department of Biomedical, Experimental and Clinical Sciences - Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.","Mauro Cozzolino , Gianmarco Troiano , Maria Elisabetta Coccia ",Women Health,2021 Mar,"Depressive Disorder, Major*,Female,Fertilization in Vitro,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Mental Health*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Prospective Studies,Reproductive Techniques, Assisted,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33593227
59,Predictive value of hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin for pregnancy outcomes in threatened abortion in first-trimester viable pregnancies,"Background: To investigate the value of a single determination of hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) for predicting the clinical outcome of patients with threatened abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Prospective study performed on 86 consecutively selected women with a diagnosis of threatened abortion and viable intrauterine pregnancy in the first trimester of pregnancy, conducted in two tertiary care hospitals. All patients underwent a single blood sample to determine hCG-H and total hCG serum levels and a transvaginal ultrasound 12-24 hours after diagnosis. Patients were monitored to determine whether the outcome was a miscarriage before the 20th week of pregnancy. Results: Forty-three women (50%) had a miscarriage during the follow-up. We observed a very high correlation between hCG-H and total hCG (r?=?0.91, p?<?0.001). Median hCG-H and total hCG from pregnancies with normal outcome was signif-icantly higher than those ending in abortion. hCG-H and total hCG were very similar predictors of pregnancy outcomes (AUC: 0.90 and 0.89, respectively). The ratio hCG-H / total hCG was a poor predictor (AUC: 0.64). Conclusion: A single hCG-H assay is helpful for predicting pregnancy outcomes in women with first trimester threatened abortion and viable or potentially viable pregnancy at the time of presentation. However, hCG-H is not a better predictor than total hCG.",Affiliation 1 Departamento de Obstetricia y Ginecología. Clínica Universidad de Navarra. Pamplona.

61,EEG-Based Sleep Staging Analysis with Functional Connectivity,"Sleep staging is important in sleep research since it is the basis for sleep evaluation and disease diagnosis. Related works have acquired many desirable outcomes. However, most of current studies focus on time-domain or frequency-domain measures as classification features using single or very few channels, which only obtain the local features but ignore the global information exchanging between different brain regions. Meanwhile, brain functional connectivity is considered to be closely related to brain activity and can be used to study the interaction relationship between brain areas. To explore the electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain mechanisms of sleep stages through functional connectivity, especially from different frequency bands, we applied phase-locked value (PLV) to build the functional connectivity network and analyze the brain interaction during sleep stages for different frequency bands. Then, we performed the feature-level, decision-level and hybrid fusion methods to discuss the performance of different frequency bands for sleep stages. The results show that (1) PLV increases in the lower frequency band (delta and alpha bands) and vice versa during different stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM); (2) alpha band shows a better discriminative ability for sleeping stages; (3) the classification accuracy of feature-level fusion (six frequency bands) reaches 96.91% and 96.14% for intra-subject and inter-subjects respectively, which outperforms decision-level and hybrid fusion methods.","Affiliations 1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou 310018, China. 2 Key Laboratory of Brain Machine Collaborative Intelligence of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou 310018, China. 3 Sleep and NeuroImaging Center, Faculty of Psychology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China. 4 Key Laboratory of Cognition and Personality, Ministry of Education, Chongqing 400715, China. 5 School of Automation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou 310018, China.","Hui Huang , Jianhai Zhang , Li Zhu , Jiajia Tang , Guang Lin , Wanzeng Kong , Xu Lei , Lei Zhu ",Sensors (Basel),2021 Mar 11,"Brain,Electroencephalography*,Sleep,Sleep Stages*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33799850
62,A real-time sleep scoring framework for closed-loop sleep manipulation in mice,"Subtle changes in sleep architecture can accompany and be symptomatic of many diseases or disorders. In order to probe and understand the complex interactions between sleep and health, the ability to model, track, and modulate sleep in preclinical animal models is vital. While various methods have been described for scoring experimental sleep recordings, few are designed to work in real time - a prerequisite for closed-loop sleep manipulation. In the present study, we have developed algorithms and software to classify sleep in real time and validated it on C57BL/6 mice (n = 8). Hidden Markov models of baseline sleep dynamics were fitted using an unsupervised algorithm to electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) data for each mouse, and were able to classify sleep in a manner highly concordant with manual scoring (Cohen's Kappa >75%) up to 3 weeks after model construction. This approach produced reasonably accurate estimates of common sleep metrics (proportion, mean duration, and number of bouts). After construction, the models were used to track sleep in real time and accomplish selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep restriction by triggering non-invasive somatosensory stimulation. During REM restriction trials, REM bout duration was significantly reduced, and the classifier continued to perform satisfactorily despite the disrupted sleep patterns. The software can easily be tailored for use with other commercial or customised methods of sleep disruption (e.g. stir bar, optogenetic stimulation, etc.) and could serve as a robust platform to facilitate closed-loop experimentation.

63,Antiviral Essential Oils Incorporated in Nanocarriers: Strategy for Prevention from COVID-19 and Future Infectious Pandemics,"Background: Coronavirus has become a life-threatening disease and it is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This new strain of coronavirus is not completely understood and to date, there is no treatment for coronavirus. Traditional ayurvedic medicines, mainly essential oils and Chinese herbs, have always played a vital role in the prevention and treatment of several epidemics and pandemics. In the meantime, guidelines of the ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha and homoepathy) include a traditional medicinal treatment for flu and fever and also recommended to boost immunity to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It is not possible to find which essential oil will offer the best level of protection. However, it is likely to assume that some essential oils are likely to offer a measurable level of defense in the same way they do with many other known viruses. Methods: Literature relevant to various essential oils having antiviral activity has been collected and compiled. Various nanocarriers of essential oils have also been stated. The database was collected using various search engines such as J-Gate, Google Scholar, Sci-Hub, PubMed, ScienceDirect, etc. Results: Essential oils contain active constituents such as phenolic compounds, terpenoids, alkaloids, phenyl propanoids, etc., which are responsible for their biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antioxidant activities and many more. However, the use of essential oils has always been limited due to poor solubility, solvent toxicity, volatility and low solubility. Many nanotechnology based carriers especially, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and microemulsion, etc. have been evidenced to overcome limitations associated with essential oils. Conclusion: Several essential oils possess potent antiviral activity and are characterized by fewer side effects and are safe for human use. The nanocarrier systems of these oils have proved the potential to treat viral and bacterial infections. Lay Summary: Current COVID-19 era demands traditional treatment for immunity boost up as support therapy.

We assessed absolute rates of RRP and differences between groups using χ2 tests. Linear tests for trend assessed change over time. Conditional logistic regression models assessed odds of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in RRPs compared with first pregnancies. Results: Overall, we captured 67 957 adolescent pregnancies during the study period. Of these, 32.9% (95% CI 32.5%-33.2%) had an RRP. Rates of RRP were higher among 18- to 19-year-olds (34.1%; 95% CI 33.6%-34.5%) than 15- to 17-year-olds (30.4%; 95% CI 29.7%-31.0%). There was substantial variation in RRP rates across provinces and territories, from 24.5% (95% CI 23.6%-35.6%) in British Columbia to 47.3% (95% CI 46.1%-48.4%) in Manitoba. Generally, the odds of maternal or neonatal morbidity were similar in second pregnancies. However, adolescents had decreased odds of having a small-for-gestational-age infant in their second pregnancy (P < 0.001), affecting 0.4% (95% CI 0.3%-0.7%) of second pregnancies. Conclusions: Adolescents who experience a pregnancy are at high risk of experiencing an RRP; however, odds of maternal and neonatal morbidity were similar in second and first pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB.

65,Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in twin gestations complicated by gestational diabetes,"Objective: Gestational diabetes (GDM) in singleton pregnancies is known to be associated with an increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The data are mixed regarding the effect of GDM on the risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in twin gestations. The objective of our study was to assess the rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in twin gestations complicated by GDM.Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized trial in which twin gestations were assigned to weekly intramuscular injections of progesterone in order to reduce the rate of preterm birth. We included all twin pregnancies with and without GDM. Women with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, twin pregnancies complicated by twin to twin transfusion syndrome and congenital fetal anomalies were excluded. Our primary outcome was the rate of hypertensive disorders in twin pregnancies complicated by GDM. Our secondary outcomes included the rate of cesarean section, number of neonates who were small for gestational age, Apgar scores, and a composite adverse neonatal outcome. Logistic regression analysis was used to control for confounding variables.Results: Six hundred fourteen twin pregnancies were included, 570 (93%) without GDM and 44 (7%) with GDM. The group with GDM had a significantly higher prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and maternal age, and were more likely to have undergone in vitro fertilization (IVF). The rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the GDM group was significantly higher when compared to the non-GDM group (31.8 versus 17.9%, p = .033, RR 1.78 [95% CI = 1.11-2.84]); however, after adjusting for maternal age, IVF treatment and prepregnancy BMI, this association lost its statistical significance (aRR = 1.36 [95% CI = 0.83-2.21]). The cesarean section rate was higher in the GDM group as compared to the non-GDM group and after adjusting for confounders, the rate of cesarean section was still higher in the GDM group (77.3 versus 61.1%, p = .003, aRR = 1.27 [95% CI = 1.06-1.50]). Neonates born to women in the GDM group were more likely to experience the adverse composite outcome (26.4 versus 8.2%, p = 0.02, RR = 1.81 [95% CI = 1.09-2.99]).Conclusion: In this prospective cohort of twin pregnancies, the rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy did not differ between women with and without gestational diabetes after adjusting for maternal age, IVF treatment, race, and prepregnancy BMI. To better target complications associated with GDM in twin gestations, large prospective studies evaluating the effect of GDM on outcomes specifically in twin pregnancies are warranted.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.","Mirella Mourad , Gloria Too , Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman , Noelia Zork ",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,2021 Mar,"Multicenter Study,Randomized Controlled Trial,Cesarean Section,Diabetes, Gestational* / epidemiology,Female,Humans,Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced* / epidemiology,Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced* / etiology,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Pregnancy, Twin,Premature Birth* / epidemiology,Premature Birth* / etiology,Prospective Studies,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31096815
66,Sleep medicine catalogue of knowledge and skills - Revision,"The 'catalogue of knowledge and skills' for sleep medicine presents the blueprint for a curriculum, a textbook, and an examination on sleep medicine. The first catalogue of knowledge and skills was presented by the European Sleep Research Society in 2014. It was developed following a formal Delphi procedure. A revised version was needed in order to incorporate changes that have occurred in the meantime in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, updates in the manual for scoring sleep and associated events, and, most important, new knowledge in sleep physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, another major change can be observed in sleep medicine: a paradigm shift in sleep medicine has taken place. Sleep medicine is no longer a small interdisciplinary field in medicine. Sleep medicine has increased in terms of recognition and importance in medical care. Consequently, major medical fields (e.g. pneumology, cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, otorhinolaryngology, paediatrics) recognise that sleep disorders become a necessity for education and for diagnostic assessment in their discipline. This paradigm change is considered in the catalogue of knowledge and skills revision by the addition of new chapters.","Affiliations 1 Sleep Medicine Center, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. 2 University of Gent, Gent, Belgium. 3 Neurology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland. 4 Neuropsychology and Functional Neuroimaging Research Unit, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Belgium. 5 Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. 6 University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. 7 Sleep Medicine Center, Department of Neuroscience, School of Medicine, University of Slit, Split, Croatia. 8 Sleep Dsorders Center, Salgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. 9 University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany. 10 University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. 11 Centre du Sommeil, Service de Physiologie - Explorationes Fonctionelles, Hopital Bichat Claude Bernard, APHP and Université Paris 7, Paris, France. 12 Child Neuropsychiatry Unit, IRCCS G.

67,Negotiating risk and choice in multifetal pregnancies,"Today, across all aspects of societal living, risk assessment is an ever-present exercise. Pervasiveness of technology in the everyday life has caused the world of 'risk' to change tremendously, and this is particularly true for childbearing females. The social construction of pregnancy and childbirth as, arguably, medical events that necessitate medical intervention - ever more so for multifetal pregnancies - makes it almost impossible to avoid the notions of risk that surround the events. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 41 mothers of twins or triplets, we investigate how understandings of risk, combined with the ideology of good motherhood and information provided by physicians impact perceptions of fetal reduction or termination. We have discussed and theorized empirical findings within the framework of risk, discourses of the responsibilization of females, and the potential 'sacred child' in a context where selective reduction becomes a potentiality.","Affiliations 1 Department of Sociology, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, 230 Elizabeth Avenue, St. John's, NL, A1C 5S7, Canada.

69,Transforming personalized nutrition practice,"The strengths and limitations of current approaches to clinical nutrition practice and their underpinning research are explored in this article. It describes how a personalized nutrition practice approach supported by evidence-based pathophysiological reasoning could direct additional research, which could then transform practice and support food industry developments. Current use of the term ""personalized nutrition"" is reviewed and a definition is provided. Also explored are current approaches to personalized nutrition practice and evidence-based practice in clinical nutrition. Patient-centered practice, which involves individuals in their healthcare decisions, is currently being provided under the name ""personalized."" An evidence-based personalized practice approach should include the use of robust, standardized, and validated tools that gather a patient's signs and symptoms, health history, family history, genetics, environment, lifestyle, social life, diet, behavior and other factors that have an impact on physiological processes. It should also gather anthropometric measures as well as functional, diagnostic, and prognostic biomarkers for pathophysiological mechanisms. Such tools would pool n = 1 data into a case-by-case evidence base that uses computational network modelling to predict the efficacy of personalized nutrition interventions. Prediction of the efficacy of interventions should also be validated using, when possible, blinded, randomized, controlled, stratified intervention studies. This model would provide practitioners with data that support evidence-based pathophysiological reasoning. It would enable clinicians to prioritize interventions on the basis of the mechanisms of action of interventions and to ameliorate the mechanisms of pathophysiology, which are a priority for the individual. Interventions then may be applied using a patient-centered practice approach. This would transform evidence-based nutrition practice into a P4 medicine approach that is personalized, preventive, predictive, and participatory. Developing pathophysiological mechanistic understanding also provides new opportunities for stakeholders, including the food industry, researchers, healthcare practitioners, and consumers.","Affiliations 1 Centre for Nutrition Education and Lifestyle Management, Wokingham, Berkshire, United Kingdom. 2 School of Health and Education, Middlesex University, Hendon, London, United Kingdom. 3 School of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, Hendon, London, United Kingdom.","Michelle Barrow , Linda Bell , Celia Bell ",Nutr Rev,2020 Dec 1,"Diet*,Dietetics / methods*,Evidence-Based Practice*,Humans,Life Style,Nutritional Status,Nutritionists,Precision Medicine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32289828
70,Estimating the Beginning of Pregnancy in German Claims Data: Development of an Algorithm With a Focus on the Expected Delivery Date,"Background: Estimating the beginning of pregnancy is crucial when studying drug safety in pregnancy, but important information in this regard, such as the last menstrual period (LMP), is generally not recorded in claims databases. The beginning of pregnancy is therefore usually estimated by subtracting a median length of pregnancy from the date of birth. Due to the variability in pregnancy lengths, this might result in non-negligible errors. German claims data may offer the possibility to estimate the beginning of pregnancy more precisely based on the expected delivery date (EDD) which can be coded once or more often during a pregnancy. Purpose: To estimate the beginning of pregnancy in German claims data focusing on the potential of the expected delivery date (EDD). Methods: We included data of all pregnancies in women aged 12-50 years ending in a live birth between 2006 and 2015 identified in the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD). We assessed the number of coded EDDs per pregnancy and the concordance if ≥ 2 EDDs were coded. We estimated the beginning of pregnancy by subtracting 280 days from the EDD or the most frequent EDD (in case of discordant EDDs). To examine plausibility, we determined the distribution of pregnancy lengths and assessed whether the gestational age at which prenatal examinations were coded was plausible. For pregnancies without EDD, the beginning was estimated by subtracting the respective observed median lengths of pregnancy for preterm births, term births, and births after due date from the actual dates of birth. Results: In 82.4% of pregnancies, at least one EDD was available (thereof 6.1% with only one EDD and 80.9% with ≥ 2 EDDs that were all concordant). The maximal difference between discordant EDDs was in median 5 days (interquartile range: 3-7 days). Based on the EDD, the median length of pregnancy was 276 days for term births and in 84.7% of pregnancies the second antibody screening test was performed in the recommended interval ± 2 weeks. In pregnancies without EDD the respective proportion was 84.9%. Conclusions: By using the EDD, the beginning of pregnancy can plausibly be estimated in German claims data.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology-BIPS, Bremen, Germany. 2 Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. 3 Berlin Institute of Health, Institut für Klinische Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Pharmakovigilanz- und Beratungszentrum für Embryonaltoxikologie, Berlin, Germany. 4 Faculty of Human and Health Sciences, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.","Tania Schink , Nadine Wentzell , Katarina Dathe , Marlies Onken , Ulrike Haug ",Front Public Health,2020 Aug 12,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Algorithms,Child,Female,Germany,Gestational Age*,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Live Birth,Menstrual Cycle*,Middle Aged,Pregnancy,Premature Birth / epidemiology,Term Birth*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32903398
71,Absolute Risk of Adverse Obstetric Outcomes Among Twin Pregnancies After In Vitro Fertilization by Maternal Age,"Importance: Twin pregnancy is a common occurrence in pregnancies conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF), but the absolute risk of adverse obstetric outcomes stratified by IVF, twin or singleton pregnancy, and maternal age are unknown. Objective: To estimate the absolute risk of adverse obstetric outcomes at each maternal age among twin pregnancies conceived with IVF. Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective cohort study included pregnant women with infants born from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018, based on the Hospital Quality Monitoring System in China. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Exposures: Twin pregnancy with IVF (IVF-T), singleton pregnancy with IVF (IVF-S), twin pregnancy with non-IVF (nIVF-T), and singleton pregnancy with non-IVF (nIVF-S). Main outcomes and measures: Sixteen obstetric outcomes, including 10 maternal complications (gestational hypertension, eclampsia and preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, placental abruption, placenta accreta, preterm birth, dystocia, cesarean delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage) and 6 neonatal complications (fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, very low birth weight, macrosomia, malformation, and stillbirth). Results: Among 16 879 728 pregnant women aged 20 to 49 years (mean [SD] age, 29.2 [4.7] years), the twin-pregnancy rates were 32.1% in the IVF group and 1.5% in the non-IVF group (relative risk, 20.8; 95% CI, 20.6-20.9). The most common adverse obstetric outcomes after pregnancy conceived with IVF were cesarean delivery (88.8%), low birth weight (43.8%), preterm birth (39.6%), gestational diabetes (20.5%), gestational hypertension and preeclampsia and eclampsia (17.5%), dystocia (16.8%), and postpartum hemorrhage (11.9%). The absolute risk of most adverse obstetric outcomes in each subgroup presented in 2 dominant patterns: Pattern A indicated the absolute risk ranging from IVF-T to nIVF-T to IVF-S to nIVF-S, and pattern B indicated the absolute risk ranging from IVF-T to IVF-S to nIVF-T to nIVF-S. Both patterns showed an elevated obstetric risk with increasing maternal age in each subgroup. Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study, twin pregnancy, IVF, and advanced maternal age were independently associated with adverse obstetric outcomes. Given these findings, promotion of the elective single embryo transfer strategy is needed to reduce multiple pregnancies following IVF technologies. Unnecessary cesarean delivery shouldh be avoided in all pregnant women.","Affiliations 1 Center for Reproductive Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. 3 National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrical and Gynecology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. 4 Key Laboratory of Assisted Reproduction, Peking University, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China. 5 National Center for Healthcare Quality Management in Obstetrics, Beijing, China. 6 Department of Biostatistics, Peking University School of Public Health, Beijing, China. 7 Clinical Trial Unit, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China. 8 Centre for Data Science in Health and Medicine, Peking University, Beijing, China. 9 China Standard Medical Information Research Center, Shenzhen, China.","Yuanyuan Wang , Huifeng Shi , Lian Chen , Danni Zheng , Xiaoyu Long , Yunjun Zhang , Haibo Wang , Ying Shi , Yangyu Zhao , Yuan Wei , Jie Qiao ",JAMA Netw Open,2021 Sep 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,China / epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Female,Fertilization in Vitro*,Humans,Maternal Age*,Middle Aged,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / epidemiology*,Pregnancy Complications / etiology,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, Twin*,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34505887

73,Physical Activity Behaviors and Barriers in Multifetal Pregnancy: What to Expect When You're Expecting More,"The health benefits of prenatal physical activity (PA) are established for singleton pregnancies. In contrast, individuals with multifetal pregnancies (twins, triplets or more) are recommended to restrict or cease PA. The objectives of the current study were to determine behaviors and barriers to PA in multifetal pregnancies. Between 29 May and 24 July 2020, individuals with multifetal pregnancies participated in an online survey. Of the 415 respondents, there were 366 (88%) twin, 45 (11%) triplet and 4 (1%) quadruplet pregnancies. Twenty-seven percent (n = 104/388) of respondents completed no PA at all during pregnancy, 57% (n = 220/388) completed PA below current recommendations, and 16% (n = 64/388) achieved current recommendations (150-min per week of moderate-intensity activity). Most respondents (n = 314/363 [87%]) perceived barriers to PA during multifetal pregnancy. The most prominent were physical symptoms (n = 204/363 [56%]) and concerns about risks to fetal wellbeing (n = 128/363 [35%]). Sixty percent (n = 92/153) felt that these barriers could be overcome but expressed the need for evidence-based information regarding PA in multifetal pregnancy. Individuals with multifetal pregnancies have low engagement with current PA recommendations but remain physically active in some capacity. There are physical and psychosocial barriers to PA in multifetal pregnancy and future research should focus on how these can be removed.","Affiliations 1 Program for Pregnancy and Postpartum Health, Physical Activity and Diabetes Laboratory, Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation, Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Alberta Diabetes Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada. 2 Departments of Medicine and Obstetrics & Gynecology, Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G3, Canada.","Victoria L Meah , Morgan C Strynadka , Rshmi Khurana , Margie H Davenport ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Apr 8,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Exercise,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*,Pregnancy Reduction, Multifetal*,Triplets,Twins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33917800
74,Herbal Medicine: Clinical Perspective and Regulatory Status,"Herbal medicines play an important role in treating various ailments due to their potentially high therapeutic values and acceptability by patients with different health complications. The practice of herbal medicine involves the use of a part of a plant, the entire plant, or a selective isolated phytoconstituent. The search for new drugs during the scientific era revived the interest in the discovery of herbal drugs from different natural resources. The present modern healthcare system involves the utilization of drugs and 50% of them are of natural origin. In recent years, there had been an upsurge in the interest for search of novel herbal drugs by the pharmaceutical industry. However, the discovery of such new novel phytomedicines involves various challenges in the identification of active constituents; their characterization, pharmacological activity, toxicity/adverse effects, drug interactions, and, most importantly, their regulatory requirements. The present review is mainly focused on the history of herbal medicine, current clinical perspective, and pharmaceutical and regulatory challenges facing herbal drugs. Moreover, problems encountered in drug discovery from herbal resources and their possible solutions have been delineated.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Hafr Al Batin, Al Jamiah, Hafr Al Batin 39524, Saudi Arabia. 2 Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Medical & Allied Sciences, K.R.

Despite the historically enriched demonstration about the use of plant as therapeutics, the pharmaceutical industries lack interest on phytochemical research compared with synthetic drug. Mostly, the absence of information about plant-based medicinal therapeutics is responsible to draw the attention of researchers to think about natural products as potential drug for detrimental diseases, such as cancer. This review will cover about clinically successful plant-based anticancer drugs and underappreciated, but potential, drugs to bridge the information gap between plant biologists and clinical researchers. Additionally, unprecedented advancement of synthetic chemistry, omics study to pin point the target genes/proteins, and efficient drug delivery system have made it easier for researchers to develop a phytochemical as an efficient anticancer drug.","Affiliation 1 Department of Biology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst 01003, MA, USA.",Mohammad Arif Ashraf ,Biomed Res Int,2020 Jan 31,"Review,Antineoplastic Agents / pharmacology*,Biological Products,Drug Delivery Systems,Drug Industry,Herbal Medicine,Humans,Medicine, Traditional,Phytochemicals / pharmacology*,Phytotherapy,Plant Extracts,Plants, Medicinal*,Antineoplastic Agents,Biological Products,Phytochemicals,Plant Extracts",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32076618
78,High-Risk Pregnancies and Their Impact on Neonatal Primary Hemostasis,"Primary hemostasis, similar to other systems in the adjusting and transitioning neonate, undergoes developmental adaptations in the first days of life. Although platelets of neonates do not differ quantitatively compared with those of adults, they functionally present with major differences, thus supporting the theory of a ""hypofunctional"" phenotype that is counterbalanced by high hematocrit and more potent von Willebrand factor multimers. No clinical effect of bleeding tendency has hence been established so far for healthy term neonates. However, discrepancies in functionality have been noted, associated with gestational age, with more pronounced platelet hyporesponsiveness in preterm neonates. Multiple methods of in vitro platelet function evaluation such as PFA-100/200, platelet aggregometry, flow cytometry, and cone and platelet analyzer have been used for assessment of neonatal primary hemostasis. Several pregnancies are characterized as ""high-risk"" when risk factors preexist in maternal history or evolve during pregnancy. These pregnancies require specialized observation as they may have unpredictable outcome. High-risk pregnancies include clinical entities such as preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced smoking during pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), autoimmune diseases, and other maternal hematological conditions. In some cases, like systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and maternal immunologically based thrombocytopenia, neonatal thrombocytopenia is regarded as a prominent hemostasis defect, while in others, like pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, both quantitative and qualitative disorders of neonatal platelets have been reported. In other pathologies, like GDM, neonatal primary hemostasis remains vastly unexplored, which raises the need for further investigation. The extent to which primary hemostasis is affected in neonates of high-risk pregnancies is the main objective of this narrative review.","Affiliations 1 Hematology Laboratory-Blood Bank, Aretaieio Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. 2 Neonatal Department, Aretaieio Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.","Marianna Politou , Vasiliki Mougiou , Maria Kollia , Rozeta Sokou , Georgios Kafalidis , Zoi Iliodromiti , Serena Valsami , Theodora Boutsikou , Nicoletta Iacovidou ",Semin Thromb Hemost,2020 Jun,"Review,Female,Hemostasis / genetics*,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Male,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, High-Risk / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31858517
79,Scoping Review on the Use of Early Warning Trigger Tools for Women in Labor,"Objective: To identify existing obstetric trigger tools, evaluate their sensitivity and specificity to correctly identify women in need of care escalation, and describe clinicians' experiences of using these tools while caring for women in labor. Data sources: Iterative searches of three databases, CINAHL, PubMed, and SCOPUS, in October 2019 and June 2020 using the keywords maternal surveillance system, obstetric∗, early warning scores, early warning systems, and trigger tools. Study selection: Primary quantitative and qualitative studies on the utility or implementation of trigger tools for women in labor that were written in English. Through the initial search, I identified 208 articles and included 11 full-text articles in this review. Data extraction: I extracted data related to aims, population, methodology, outcomes, and key findings for each study and entered them into a matrix based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Review Guidelines. Data synthesis: Quantitative researchers found that the sensitivity and specificity to correctly identify women in need of care escalation of tools varied and recommended that institutions should consider the burdens of false positives versus the risks of false negatives when choosing a tool for their contexts. Qualitative researchers described clinicians' experiences with the use of trigger tools and systems-level barriers to implementation, including lack of training, poor management of implementation, increased workload due to redundant charting, and belief that tools were not appropriate for women with low-risk pregnancies. Greater rates of false positives led clinicians to use trigger tools only for women with high-risk pregnancies rather than as a screening tool for all women. Conclusion: Trigger tools may help with early identification of worsening clinical condition, but further research is needed to refine and improve tools, as well as understand best practices for tool implementation. Systems-level factors should be considered in tool selection.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,Samantha Bernstein,J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs,2021 May,"Review,Family,Female,Humans,Labor, Obstetric*,Pregnancy,Qualitative Research",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33549533
80,"Crosstalk between obesity, diabetes, and alzheimer's disease: Introducing quercetin as an effective triple herbal medicine","Obesity and diabetes are the most common metabolic disorders, which are strongly related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in aging. Diabetes and obesity can lead to the accumulation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and other symptoms of AD through several pathways, including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines dysregulation, and vascular impairment. Currently, the use of polyphenols has been expanded in animal models and in-vitro studies because of their comparatively negligible adverse effects. Among them, quercetin (QT) is one of the most abundant polyphenolic flavonoids, which is present in fruits and vegetables and displays many biological, health-promoting effects in a wide range of diseases. The low bioavailability and poor solubility of QT have also led researchers to make various QT-involved nanoparticles (NPs) to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we review significant molecular mechanisms induced by diabetes and obesity that increase AD pathogenesis. Then, we summarize in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence regarding the anti-Alzheimer, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects of QT. Finally, QT in pure and combination form using NPs has been suggested as a promising therapeutic agent for future studies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Cell and Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran. 2 Department of Cell and Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.

82,"Medicaid, motherhood, and the challenges of having a healthy pregnancy amidst changing social networks","Background: African American women with low income face various challenges to having a healthy pregnancy. Unplanned pregnancies often amplify those challenges and negatively impact women's ability to get the care that she needs. Research has shown that social networks can improve pregnancy outcomes by helping women cope with and address the problems that they face. However, there is little research on how unintended pregnancy impacts the medical and social support that African American women receive. Aim: This research explored how unintended pregnancies impact women's social networks and the type of support that they need throughout the pregnancy. Design and sample: This ethnographic study included 20 African American women who used pregnancy services at a health department in the United States. Fourteen women were enrolled in the study during their first or second trimester and were interviewed upon enrollment, in their third trimester, and within one month of giving birth. An additional six women were enrolled and interviewed within one month of giving birth. Results: African American women's needs and social support networks change throughout their pregnancy. When medical providers primarily offer pregnancy information and referrals to social service agencies during the first trimester, problems that women have later in the pregnancy are not properly addressed. Conclusion: Social support needs to be accessed at multiple times during the pregnancy. Pregnancy resources should be provided throughout the pregnancy, recognizing that social support and personal struggles evolve during the pregnancy.","Affiliation 1 Saint Anthony College of Nursing, 3301 North Mulford Rd, Rockford, IL, 61114, United States.

83,The role of parental self-regulation and household chaos in parent-toddler interactions: A time-series study,"Various studies have reported that parental self-regulation is inversely related to negative parenting practices, especially in relatively calm households. These studies have focused on general tendencies of parents over longer periods of time. In the current time-series study, we extended previous work by focusing on the moment-to-moment processes in parent-child interactions that may explain associations between parental self-regulation, household chaos, and negative parenting practices. In a sample of 62 parent-toddler dyads (83.87% mothers), we tested whether observed contingent negative responses to child noncompliance (i.e., reactive negative parenting) could be predicted by the interaction between parental self-regulation and household chaos. Additionally, we examined whether two indicators of parental self-regulation, self-reported effortful control and task-based executive functioning, had similar associations with reactive negative parenting. Reactive negative parenting was assessed during clean up and was calculated as parents' propensity to show negative parenting practices immediately after their child showed noncompliance. We found that lower parental self-regulation predicted more reactive negative parenting practices in moderately chaotic households. Associations were similar regardless of whether self-regulation was operationalized as effortful control or executive functioning. The findings demonstrate that less regulated parents may benefit from a home situation that is tidy, calm, and characterized by routine in order to remain neutral in situations in which their toddler is noncompliant.

84,Subcritical Water Extraction of Salvia miltiorrhiza,"In this work, a green extraction technique, subcritical water extraction (SBWE), was employed to extract active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from an important Chinese medicinal herb, Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen), at various temperatures. The APIs included tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, protocatechualdehyde, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid. Traditional herbal decoction (THD) of Salvia miltiorrhiza was also carried out for comparison purposes. Reproduction assay of herbal extracts obtained by both SBWE and THD were then conducted on Caenorhabditis elegans so that SBWE conditions could be optimized for the purpose of developing efficacious herbal medicine from Salvia miltiorrhiza. The extraction efficiency was mostly enhanced with increasing extraction temperature. The quantity of tanshinone I in the herbal extract obtained by SBWE at 150 °C was 370-fold higher than that achieved by THD extraction. Reproduction evaluation revealed that the worm reproduction rate decreased and the reproduction inhibition rate increased with elevated SBWE temperatures. Most importantly, the reproduction inhibition rate of the SBWE herbal extracts obtained at all four temperatures investigated was higher than that of traditional herbal decoction extracts. The results of this work show that there are several benefits of subcritical water extraction of medicinal herbs over other existing herbal medicine preparation techniques. Compared to THD, the thousand-year-old and yet still popular herbal preparation method used in herbal medicine, subcritical water extraction is conducted in a closed system where no loss of volatile active pharmaceutical ingredients occurs, although analyte degradation may happen at higher temperatures. Temperature optimization in SBWE makes it possible to be more efficient in extracting APIs from medicinal herbs than the THD method. Compared to other industrial processes of producing herbal medicine, subcritical water extraction eliminates toxic organic solvents. Thus, subcritical water extraction is not only environmentally friendly but also produces safer herbal medicine for patients.","Affiliations 1 Department of Chemistry, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA. 2 Department of Biology, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.","Brahmam Kapalavavi , Ninad Doctor , Baohong Zhang , Yu Yang ",Molecules,2021 Mar 15,"Abietanes / chemistry,Benzaldehydes / chemistry,Caffeic Acids / chemistry,Catechols / chemistry,Coumaric Acids / chemistry,Drugs, Chinese Herbal / chemistry,Hot Temperature,Plant Extracts / chemistry*,Plants, Medicinal / chemistry,Salvia miltiorrhiza / chemistry*,Water / chemistry*,Abietanes,Benzaldehydes,Caffeic Acids,Catechols,Coumaric Acids,Drugs, Chinese Herbal,Plant Extracts,tanshinone,Water,dan-shen root extract,protocatechualdehyde,ferulic acid,caffeic acid",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33804141

86,Herbal Medicine for Pain Management: Efficacy and Drug Interactions,"Complementary and alternative medicines such as herbal medicines are not currently part of the conventional medical system. As the popularity of and global market for herbal medicine grows among all age groups, with supporting scientific data and clinical trials, specific alternative treatments such as herbal medicine can be reclassified as a practice of conventional medicine. One of the most common conditions for which adults use herbal medicine is pain. However, herbal medicines carry safety concerns and may impact the efficacy of conventional therapies. Unfortunately, mechanisms of action are poorly understood, and their use is unregulated and often underreported to medical professionals. This review aims to compile common and available herbal medicines which can be used as an alternative to or in combination with conventional pain management approaches. Efficacy and safety are assessed through clinical studies on pain relief. Ensuing herb-drug interactions such as cytochrome modulation, additive and synergistic effects, and contraindications are discussed. While self-management has been recognized as part of the overall treatment strategy for patients suffering from chronic pain, it is important for practitioners to be able to also optimize and integrate herbal medicine and, if warranted, other complementary and alternative medicines into their care.","Affiliations 1 Department of Anesthesiology, Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, 836W.

87,Recent innovations of ultrasound green technology in herbal phytochemistry: A review,"Ultrasound (US) has become one of the most important techniques in green chemistry and emerging technologies. Many research investigations documented the usefulness of US in a wide range of applications in food science, nanotechnology, and complementary medicine, where effective extraction of natural products is important. However, as with all novel technologies, US has advantages and limitations that require clarification for full adaptation at an industrial scale. The present review discusses recent applications of US in herbal phytochemistry with the emphasis on US effects on chemical structures of bioactive compounds extracted from herbs and their bioactivities. The impact of different US processing conditions such as frequency, intensity, duration, temperature, and pressure on the effectiveness of the extraction process and the properties of the extracted materials are also discussed. Different frequencies and intensities of US have demonstrated its potential applications in modifying, determining, and predicting the physicochemical properties of herbs and their extracts. US has important applications in nanotechnology where it supports the fabrication of inexpensive and eco-friendly herbal nanostructures, as well as acoustic-based biosensors for chemical imaging of the herbal tissues. The application of US enhances the rates of chemical processes such as hydrolysis of herbal fibers, which reduces the time and energy consumed without affecting the quality of the final products. Overall, the use of US in herbal science has great potential to create novel chemical constructions and to be used as an innovative diagnostic system in various biomedical, food, and analytical applications.","Affiliations 1 College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, 866 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou 310058, China; Department of Nutrition & Food Science, National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza, Egypt.

89,Coronavirus Disease-2019 Treatment Strategies Targeting Interleukin-6 Signaling and Herbal Medicine,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is evolving across the world and new treatments are urgently needed as with vaccines to prevent the illness and stem the contagion. The virus affects not only the lungs but also other tissues, thus lending support to the idea that COVID-19 is a systemic disease. The current vaccine and treatment development strategies ought to consider such systems medicine perspectives rather than a narrower focus on the lung infection only. COVID-19 is associated with elevated levels of the inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Elevated levels of cytokines and the cytokine storm have been linked to fatal disease. This suggests new therapeutic strategies through blocking the cytokine storm. IL-6 is one of the major cytokines associated with the cytokine storm. IL-6 is also known to display pleiotropic/diverse pathophysiological effects. We suggest the blockage of IL-6 signaling and its downstream mediators such as Janus kinases (JAKs), and signal transducer and activators of transcription (STATs) offer potential hope for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Thus, repurposing of already approved IL-6-JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors as well as other anti-inflammatory drugs, including dexamethasone, is under development for severe COVID-19 cases. We conclude this expert review by highlighting the potential role of precision herbal medicines, for example, the Cannabis sativa, provided that omics technologies can be utilized to build a robust scientific evidence base on their clinical safety and efficacy. Precision herbal medicine buttressed by omics systems science would also help identify new molecular targets for drug discovery against COVID-19.","Affiliations 1 International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), Cape Town, South Africa. 2 Division of Medical Biochemistry and Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Department of Integrative Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. 3 Department of Chemical Engineering, Vaal University of Technology, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa. 4 Division of Human Genetics, Department of Pathology, Institute for Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. 5 Immunology Department, Pathology, University Hospital Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom. 6 Faculty of Science, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, United Kingdom.","Kevin Dzobo , Harry Chiririwa , Collet Dandara , Witness Dzobo ",OMICS,2021 Jan,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Antiviral Agents / pharmacology,Antiviral Agents / therapeutic use*,Biological Products / pharmacology,Biological Products / therapeutic use*,COVID-19 / complications,COVID-19 / drug therapy*,COVID-19 / metabolism*,COVID-19 / virology,Clinical Trials as Topic,Cytokine Release Syndrome / drug therapy,Cytokine Release Syndrome / etiology,Cytokines / metabolism,Drug Repositioning,Herbal Medicine* / methods,Humans,Interleukin-6 / metabolism*,SARS-CoV-2 / drug effects*,Signal Transduction / drug effects*,Antiviral Agents,Biological Products,Cytokines,Interleukin-6",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32857671
90,Considering cross-cultural differences in sleep duration between Japanese and Canadian university students,"Sleep is a fundamental biological process that all humans exhibit, and there is much evidence that people suffer adverse health outcomes from insufficient sleep. Despite this evidence, much research demonstrates significant heterogeneity in the amounts that people sleep across cultures. This suggests that despite serving fundamental biological functions, sleep is also subject to cultural influence. Using self-report and actigraphy data we examined sleep among European Canadian, Asian Canadian, and Japanese university students. Significant cultural differences emerged in terms of various parameters of sleep (e.g. sleep time), and beliefs about sleep (e.g. perceived relation between sleep and health). Despite sleeping significantly less than European Canadians, Japanese participants slept less efficiently, yet reported being less tired and having better health. Moreover, relative to European Canadians, Japanese participants perceived a weaker relation between sleep and physical health, and had a significantly shorter ideal amount of sleep. Asian Canadians' sleep behaviors and attitudes were largely similar to European Canadians suggesting that people acculturate to local cultural sleep norms.","Affiliations 1 University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. 2 Shiga University, Shiga, Japan. 3 Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.","Benjamin Y Cheung , Kosuke Takemura , Christine Ou , Anne Gale , Steven J Heine ",PLoS One,2021 Apr 26,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Actigraphy,Asians,Canada,Cross-Cultural Comparison*,Female,Health Status,Humans,Male,Self Report,Sleep / physiology*,Students,Surveys and Questionnaires,Universities,Whites,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33901233

92,Transabdominal fetal reduction: a report of 124 cases,"To prevent fetal loss, preterm delivery, and perinatal morbidity of multifetal pregnancies (MPs), fetal reduction (FR) is offered to some patients. We retrospectively analysed the data of 124 MPs that underwent transabdominal FR to twin (n = 63) and singleton (n = 61) pregnancies at a mean gestational age of 12 + 6 weeks between December 2006 and January 2018. FR was performed transabdominally with the injection of potassium chloride into the intracardiac or intrathoracic space of the fetus or fetuses after ultrasound screening for nuchal translucency and anatomical defects. The initial number of embryos were 48 twins, 63 triplets, 11 quadruplets, and 2 quintuplets. The procedure-related pregnancy loss rate was 0.8% (1/124), the overall pregnancy loss rate was 2.4% (3/124), the fetal loss rate was 1.6% (2/124), and the neonatal death rate was 0.8% (1/124). The baby take-home rates were 96% for twin pregnancies and 96.7% for singletons. This study shows that transabdominal FR is an effective and safe procedure with a pregnancy loss rate of 2.4%.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? The incidence of multifetal pregnancies has increased over the years. Because multifetal pregnancies increase perinatal morbidity and mortality due to prematurity, fetal reduction is offed to some patients.What the results of this study add? The results of this study add to the growing body of research on fetal reduction. The study showed that transabdominal fetal reduction is a safe procedure with a pregnancy loss rate of 2.4%.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

94,Association between preconception paternal health and pregnancy loss in the USA: an analysis of US claims data,"Study question: Is preconception paternal health associated with pregnancy loss? Summary answer: Poor preconception paternal health is associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss as confirmed in sensitivity analyses accounting for maternal age and health. What is known already: Preconception paternal health can negatively impact perinatal outcomes. Study design, size, duration: Retrospective cohort study of US insurance claims database from 2009 to 2016 covering 958 804 pregnancies. Participants/materials, setting, methods: US insurance claims database including women, men and pregnancies within the USA between 2007 and 2016. Paternal preconception health status (e.g. metabolic syndrome diagnoses (MetS), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and individual chronic disease diagnoses) was examined in relation to pregnancy loss (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and stillbirth). Main results and the role of chance: In all, 958 804 pregnancies were analyzed. The average paternal age was 35.3 years (SD 5.3) and maternal age was 33.1 years (SD 4.4). Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies ended in a loss. After adjusting for maternal factors, the risk of pregnancy loss increased with increasing paternal comorbidity. For example, compared to men with no components of MetS, the risk of pregnancy loss increased for men with one (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.09-1.12), two (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.17) or three or more (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.24) components. Specifically, less healthy men had a higher risk of siring a pregnancy ending in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and ectopic pregnancies. Similar patterns remained with other measures of paternal health (e.g. CCI, chronic diseases, etc.). When stratifying by maternal age as well as maternal health, a similar pattern of increasing pregnancy loss risk for men with 1, 2 or 3+ MetS was observed. A statistically significant but weak association between timing of pregnancy loss and paternal health was found. Limitations, reasons for caution: Retrospective study design covering only employer insured individuals may limit generalizability. Wider implications of the findings: Optimization of a father's health may improve pregnancy outcomes.

95,Nutrigenomics: lessons learned and future perspectives,"The omics technologies of metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics are playing an increasingly important role in nutrition science. With the emergence of the concept of precision nutrition and the need to understand individual responses to dietary interventions, it is an opportune time to examine the impact of these tools to date in human nutrition studies. Advances in our mechanistic understanding of dietary interventions were realized through incorporation of metabolomics, proteomics, and, more recently, metagenomics. A common observation across the studies was the low intra-individual variability of the omics measurements and the high inter-individual variation. Harnessing this data for use in the development of precision nutrition will be important. Metabolomics in particular has played a key role in the development of biomarkers of food intake in an effort to enhance the accuracy of dietary assessments. Further work is needed to realize the full potential of such biomarkers and to demonstrate integration with current strategies, with the goal of overcoming the well-established limitations of self-reported approaches. Although many of the nutrigenomic studies performed to date were labelled as proof-of-concept or pilot studies, there is ample evidence to support the use of these technologies in nutrition science. Incorporating omic technologies from the start of study designs will ensure that studies are sufficiently powered for such data. Furthermore, multi-disciplinary collaborations are likely to become even more important to aid analyses and interpretation of the data.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Food and Health and Conway Institute, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Agriculture and Food Science, UCD, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland. 2 The Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, United Kingdom.","Lorraine Brennan , Baukje de Roos ",Am J Clin Nutr,2021 Mar 11,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Biomarkers,Eating,Humans,Nutrigenomics*,Nutritional Status,Precision Medicine,Research Design*,Weight Loss,Biomarkers",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33515029
96,The toxicologic pathology aspects of selected natural herbal products and related compounds,"Herbal products have been in use for many years, but they are becoming more and more popular in recent years, and they are currently in widespread use throughout the world. In this review article we describe the histopathologic findings found after exposure to 12 dietary herbals in studies conducted in rodent model systems. Clear or some evidence for carcinogenic activity was seen with 6 herbals, with the liver being the most common organ affected. The intestine was affected by two herbals (aloe vera nondecolorized extract and senna), three had no clear evidence for carcinogenic activity and one was cardiotoxic (Ephedrine and Ephedra in combination with caffeine). Information from these studies can help to better understand potential target organs for further evaluation from exposure to various herbal products.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel. 2 Department of Dermatology, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. 3 Consultant in Toxicologic Pathology, Yehuda HaMaccabi 31, floor 5, Tel Aviv 6200515, Israel. 4 Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. 5 Toxicology Branch, Division of the National Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.","Ruba Ibrahim , Abraham Nyska , June Dunnick , Yuval Ramot ",J Toxicol Pathol,2021 Jul,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34290474
97,A Youth-Friendly Pharmacy Initiative: Decreasing Unintended Pregnancies Among Disenfranchised Youth,"Teens from neighborhoods that have experienced historical and contemporary disinvestment have among the highest rates of teen pregnancy, yet they have less access to resources to reduce unintended pregnancies. In recognition of this, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) developed the Youth-Friendly Pharmacy Initiative. Over 7 consecutive months in 2015, educational materials and free NYCDOHMH condoms were placed strategically in independent pharmacies in the South Bronx. Refills were made monthly. Pharmacists were directed to order free refills from the NYCDOHMH after the project ended. To evaluate the feasibility of the study, a survey with teens (15-19 years) at the study midpoint and a 3-month post follow-up assessment were conducted. The retention rate over 7 months was 96.4% (27/28 pharmacies). Forty-three percent (2,068/4,830) of the booklets and 87.9% (43,841/49,850) of the condoms were taken by patrons. The posters and pamphlets were recognized by 63.6% and 27.3% of the teens, respectively. Forty-percent of the teens were aware of the free condoms, and one third had taken the free condoms. In the post assessment, 20% of the sampled pharmacies independently sought out resources for free condom refills. Pharmacies are positive sexual and reproductive health resources for underserved teens.","Affiliation 1 New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York City, NY, USA.","Calpurnyia B Roberts , Jane Bedell ",Health Promot Pract,2020 Mar,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Condoms,Female,Humans,New York City,Pharmacies*,Pharmacy*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30175629
98,Muscle Activity Detection during Sleep by Ear-EEG,"Muscle activation during sleep is an important biomarker in the diagnosis of several sleep disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Muscle activity is typically assessed manually based on the EMG channels from polysomnography recordings. Ear-EEG provides a mobile and comfortable alternative for sleep assessment. In this study, ear-EEG was used to automatically detect muscle activities during sleep. The study was based on a dataset comprising four full night recordings from 20 healthy subjects with concurrent polysomnography and ear-EEG. A binary label, active or relax, extracted from the chin EMG was assigned to selected 30 s epoch of the sleep recordings in order to train a classifier to predict muscle activation. We found that the ear-EEG based classifier detected muscle activity with an accuracy of 88% and a Cohen's kappa value of 0.71 relative to the labels derived from the chin EMG channels. The analysis also showed a significant difference in the distribution of muscle activity between REM and non-REM sleep.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Yousef R Tabar, Kaare B Mikkelsen, Mike Lind Rank, Martin Christian Hemmsen, Preben Kidmose",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,2020 Jul,"Electroencephalography,Humans,Musculoskeletal Physiological Phenomena*,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Stages*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33018155
99,Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment for COVID-2019: Is China ready for implementing a national guideline?,"Objectives: COVID-19 sparked a pandemic in December 2019 and is currently posing a huge impact globally. Chinese herbal medicine is incorporated into the Chinese national guideline for COVID-19 management, emphasising the individualisation of herbal treatment guided by pattern differentiation, which is an ICD-11-endorsed approach. However, this was not widely implemented with many provincial governments and hospitals developing their own guideline, suggesting the use of standardised herbal formulae and herbal active ingredients without pattern differentiation. Methods: Through the case study of COVID-19 guideline implementation, we compared the three approaches of developing Chinese herbal medicine, namely pattern differentiation-guided prescription, standardised herbal formulae, and herbal active ingredients, in terms of their strengths, limitations, and determinants of adoption. Results: Pattern differentiation-guided prescription is the practice style taught in the national syllabus among universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China, yet the lack of relevant diagnostic research reduces its reliability and hinders its implementation. Application of standardised herbal formulae is straightforward since the majority of clinical evidence on Chinese herbal medicine is generated using this approach. Nevertheless, it is downplayed by regulatory bodies in certain jurisdictions where the use of pattern differentiation is required in routine practice. Although herbal active ingredients may have clear in vitro therapeutic mechanisms, this may not be translated into real world clinical effectiveness. Conclusions: Multiple COVID-19 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine prescribed using one of the three approaches described above are progressing. These results will demonstrate the comparative effectiveness among these approaches. Forthcoming clinical evidence from these trials should inform the updating process of the national guideline, such that its recognition and compliance may be strengthened. For longer-term development Chinese herbal medicine, serious investment for establishing high-quality clinical research infrastructure is urgently needed.","Affiliations 1 The Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. 2 School of Chinese Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. 3 Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, China.","Vincent C H Chung , Leonard T F Ho , Irene X Y Wu ",Adv Integr Med,2020 May,Editorial,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32837890
100,Pregnancy and Abortion: Experiences and Attitudes of Deployed U.S. Servicewomen,"Introduction: More U.S. servicewomen than civilian women experience unintended pregnancies, which can impact their health, well-being, and careers. Despite this, federal policy limits abortion access and coverage for military personnel to cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment. This study aimed to document servicewomen's experiences with unintended pregnancy and abortion during deployment, and their knowledge and opinions of military policies related to sexual activity, pregnancy, and abortion. Material and methods: Between June 2016 and July 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among a convenience sample of current and former U.S. Military, National Guard, and Reserves members whose last deployment ended in 2010 or later. We asked open- and closed-ended questions about demographics, experiences with pregnancy and abortion during deployment, and knowledge and opinions of military policies related to sexual activity, pregnancy, and abortion. We ran descriptive statistics on closed-ended questions and inductively coded open-ended question responses. This study was approved by the Allendale Investigational Review Board. Results: A total of 319 participants were included. The majority said that servicewomen are reprimanded for sexual activity and becoming pregnant during deployment in all or some circumstances. Among these respondents, one-third said that fear of reprimand for sexual activity affects deployed servicewomen's use of contraception. Twenty respondents became pregnant or discovered that they were pregnant during deployment; twelve were unable to access the pregnancy- and/or abortion-related services they wanted or needed. Among those whose last deployment ended in 2013 or later (n = 141), when federal policy expanded abortion coverage for servicemembers to include cases of rape and incest, the minority knew the correct coverage or provision policies for abortion in cases of rape and incest or life endangerment. The majority believed that the military should cover and provide abortion in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment and for unwanted pregnancies. Conclusion: Among this convenience sample of current and former servicewomen with an overseas deployment that ended in 2010 or later, 6% became pregnant or discovered that they were pregnant during deployment, and most of these respondents reported being unable to access the pregnancy- and/or abortion-related services they wanted or needed. The majority reported lack of knowledge of military abortion policies and that servicewomen are reprimanded for pregnancy and/or sexual activity in some or all circumstances, with many noting this reprimand as a barrier to contraceptive use for some servicewomen. Predeployment health visits may be one intervention point for disseminating the military's abortion policies; commanding officers should also be well versed in these policies so that they are able to provide effective leadership to junior military members.","Affiliations 1 Ibis Reproductive Health, 2067 Massachusetts Avenue, Suite 320, Cambridge, MA 02140. 2 Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, Bixby Center for Global and Reproductive Health, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, 1153 Franklin St, Oakland, CA 94612.","Jane W Seymour , Laura Fix , Daniel Grossman , Kate Grindlay ",Mil Med,2020 Sep 18,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Abortion, Induced*,Attitude,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Health Services Accessibility*,Humans,Military Personnel*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32779707
101,"Being parent of a child with congenital heart disease, what does it mean? A qualitative research","Background: Childbirth is one of the invaluable human experiences and is associated with parental happiness. However, when a child is born with congenital heart disease, it creates emotional and mental distress. As a result, it changes the parents' response to their child birth. Exploring parenthood experiences add to the body of knowledge and reveal new perspectives. In order to make healthcare professionals able to support these children and their families, they should first understand the meaning of this phenomenon. This study aimed to explore the meaning of parenting a child with Congenital Heart Disease in Iran. Methods: A qualitative study was adopted with a conventional content analysis approach and constant comparative analysis. Participants in this study were 17 parents, including parents of children with congenital heart disease who were selected by purposeful sampling method. Semi-structured interviews were used for data collection and continued to data saturation. Data were analyzed via MAXQDA 10 software. Results: Four categories and twenty three subcategories emerged as meaning of parenting a child with Congenital Heart Disease. Categories include ""Emotional breakdown"", ""The catastrophic burden of care"", ""Spiritual beliefs of parents"" and ""The hard road"" CONCLUSIONS: Fully understanding the life experience of these families will allow the implementation of targeted health interventions. Hence, by understanding the meaning of parenting a child with Congenital Heart Disease, healthcare professionals can asses parents emotional statues, information and spiritual needs, financial condition, insurance and marital status using CHD standards so that support is individualized, sensitive and time appropriate.","Affiliations 1 School of Nursing and Midwifery, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tohid Square, Tohid Square, Nosrat St, Tehran, Iran. 2 Medicine Faculty, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Kurdistan, Iran. 3 School of Nursing and Midwifery, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tohid Square, Tohid Square, Nosrat St, Tehran, Iran.

102,Perimenopausal contraception,"Purpose of review: Perimenopause is a time of reduced fertility, and yet unintended pregnancies can occur making comprehensive contraceptive counseling essential for these women. Concern over potential contraceptive risks has unnecessarily limited access and use of certain hormonal methods in this population. This review summarizes the available data on the use and effectiveness of contraceptive options during perimenopause. Recent findings: All contraceptive options may be appropriate during perimenopause and no method is contraindicated based on age alone. Combined hormonal contraception has the added benefit of relieving perimenopausal symptoms including controlling menstrual irregularities. Progestin-only methods have the advantage of being taken either alone or in combination with estrogen replacement therapy to address both perimenopausal symptoms and contraceptive needs. Nonhormonal options exist for those wishing to avoid hormonal methods. Summary: Extensive contraceptive options are available for perimenopausal women as they transition into menopause. Consideration of patient preference, medical co-morbidities, and perimenopausal symptoms will allow women to use the option that best serves her needs.","Affiliations 1 Division of Family Planning, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. 2 Division of Endocrinology, Gerontology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California, USA.","Amy J Voedisch , Danit Ariel ",Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,2020 Dec,"Review,Contraception*,Contraceptive Agents,Female,Humans,Menopause,Perimenopause*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned,Contraceptive Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33002952
103,Twin pregnancies,"Twin pregnancies, resulting in 2-3 % of all deliveries, are high risk pregnancies which need specialized care. A correct dating of pregnancy and the assessment of the chorionicity/amnionicity in the first trimester (< = 13 + 6 gestational weeks, GW) is essential for further monitoring. During first trimester risk stratification of monochorionic pregnancies includes evaluation of discordance of crown-rump-lengths, nuchal translucencies and amniotic fluid. At 16 GW sonographic risk evaluation of monochorionic twins involves differences in amniotic fluid and abdominal circumferences and detection of a velamentous cord insertion. A screening for fetal malformations with cervical length measurement as screening for preterm birth (cut-off < 25 mm) should be offered all twin pregnancies around 20 GW. In uncomplicated dichorionic pregnancies US examination should be performed every 4 weeks onwards to check fetal growth and amniotic fluid. An intertwin weight discordance > 20 % identifies pregnancies at increased risk of adverse outcome. Monochorionic pregnancies should be followed at least every two weeks for screening of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin-anemia-polycythemia-sequence (TAPS) and selective fetal growth retardation (sFGR) with a start at 16 GW. The type 1-3 classification of sFGR in monochorionic twins depends on the pattern of end-diastolic velocity at the umbilical artery Doppler. The diagnosis of TTTS requires the presence of an oligyohydramnios (deepest vertical pocket (DVP) < 2 cm) in the donor twin and a polyhydramnios (DVP > 8 cm) in the recipient twin. However, the diagnosis of TAPS is based on the finding of discordant MCA Doppler values with a delta-MCA PV > 0.5 MoM.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zürich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",Nicole Ochsenbein-Kölble ,Ultraschall Med,2021 Jun,"Female,Fetal Growth Retardation / diagnostic imaging,Fetofetal Transfusion* / diagnostic imaging,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Premature Birth*,Twins, Monozygotic,Ultrasonography, Prenatal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622004
104,Late-term pregnancy: Navigating in unknown waters - A hermeneutic study,"Background: Late-term pregnancy is related to increased risk of serious complications for babies and women, as pregnancies proceed. Pregnancy is an individual, complex and existential situation for women, who may experience late-term pregnancy as a mentally strenuous period, characterised by worries and anxiety. However, there is a lack of studies in this area. Aim: To describe women's experiences of late-term pregnancy ≥41 gestational weeks. Methods: A lifeworld hermeneutic approach was used. Qualitative interviews were performed with ten women, two to seven months after the birth. Findings: Six themes emerged from the analysis Doubting the body's ability to cope with the transition from pregnancy to giving birth, The importance of their partner's support during the sea voyage, Lacking clear guidelines for the voyage, Worrying about the cargo at the end of the voyage, How the voyage turned out and Thoughts related to a future voyage. Conclusion: The women did not feel sufficiently empowered to trust their body's ability to make the transition from late pregnancy to birth. It is vital that midwives provide clear guidance and empower women to trust the ability of their body to give birth. This transition is important in relation to positive thoughts about future pregnancies and births.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Health and Care Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, S-405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden.

Nowadays, the popularity of using herbal medicines in daily life, as well as clinical practices, has gradually expanded to numerous Western countries with positive impacts and acceptance. The continuous growth of the herbal consumption market has promoted standardization and modernization of herbal-derived products with present pharmacological criteria. To store and extensively share this knowledge with the community and serve scientific research, various herbal metabolite databases have been developed with diverse focuses under the support of modern advances. The advent of these databases has contributed to accelerating research on pharmaceuticals of natural origins. In the scope of this study, we critically review 30 herbal metabolite databases, discuss different related perspectives, and provide a comparative analysis of 18 accessible noncommercial ones.

106,Effect of pregnancy intention on the timing and sustained use of antenatal care services in Rwanda,"We investigated the relationship between intended pregnancy and utilization of antenatal care services in Rwanda. Using Demographic and Health Survey 2014/2015, secondary data was obtained on maternal health services utilization. We performed stepwise logistic regression analysis to examine the effect of independent variables on women's early and late utilization, as well as their sustained use of antenatal services. Dependent and main independent variables included: first trimester visits, completed antenatal visits and intended pregnancy respectively. Of 5,944 women sampled; 56.6% had made early antenatal visits and 44% had completed 4 visits. Unintended pregnancies were less likely to make early antenatal visits and complete 4 antenatal visits. Religion and being in union had positive association with standard antenatal visits; while age (>24 years), grand multiparty, and poor economic status had negative association. Our results call for deeper sensitization on utilization of antenatal services and more use of contraception to reduce unintended pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 University of Rwanda, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of medicine and pharmacy. 2 University of Rwanda, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Public Health. 3 University of Western Ontario, department of Geography.","Patrick G Bagambe , Aline Umubyeyi , Isaac Luginaah ",Afr J Reprod Health,2021 Feb,"Adolescent,Adult,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Intention*,Maternal Health,Maternal Health Services / statistics & numerical data*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care / statistics & numerical data*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned / psychology*,Pregnancy, Unwanted / psychology*,Prenatal Care / statistics & numerical data*,Rwanda,Socioeconomic Factors,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34077115
107,Herbal Medicine Use During Pregnancy: A Review of the Literature With a Special Focus on Sub-Saharan Africa,"Herbal medicine use has grown considerably worldwide among pregnant women, and is particularly widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. However, herbal medicines used across sub-Saharan Africa are associated with important research gaps and a lack of regulatory framework. This is particularly problematic, as herbal medicine use during pregnancy raises several concerns attributed to the herbal ingredient itself, conventional drug-herbal medicine interactions, and contamination or adulteration of herbal remedies. Moreover, several local herbal remedies used by sub-Saharan African pregnant women have never been botanically identified. In this review, an overview of the practice of herbal medicine, including the regulations, challenges and overall safety, is provided. Then, we discuss the prevalence of herbal medicine use during pregnancy across different sub-Saharan African countries, as well as the indications, adverse outcomes, and effectiveness of the most commonly used herbal medicines during pregnancy in that region.","Affiliations 1 Centre for International Health, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. 2 Medical Affairs, Partner 4 Health, Paris, France. 3 Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. 4 Centre for Pharmacy, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.","Magalie El Hajj , Lone Holst ",Front Pharmacol,2020 Jun 9,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32581815
108,Neonatal outcomes between discordant monochorionic and dichorionic twins,"Objectives: This study aimed to compare obstetrical complications and neonatal outcomes between monochorionic and dichorionic discordant twin pregnancies. Study design: We enrolled 296 patients with twin pregnancy who delivered at Busan Paik Hospital between January 2014 and December 2017. The prevalence of obstetrical complications, neonatal mortality between monochorionic and dichorionic twins was compared. We also investigated whether there is a difference in neonatal outcome and neonatal morbidity between monochorionic discordant twins without monochorionic-specific complications and dichorionic discordant twins. Results: The risk of fetal death in utero (13.2 versus 5.2%, p = .025) and inter twin birth weight discordance (35.1 versus 20.8%, p = .031) is increased in monochorionic twins than in dichorionic twins. However, no difference was noted in obstetrical complication and neonatal mortality and morbidity between two groups. Among twin pregnancies with intertwin birth weight discordance, after excluding fetal death in utero and monochorionic specific complication, there was no difference in obstetrical complication and neonatal mortality and morbidity according to chorionicity. There was no difference in neonatal morbidity between monochorionic twins and dichorionic twins when comparing larger neonates and smaller neonates of each group. Conclusions: Risk of birth weight discordance is higher in monochorionic twin but no significant difference was observed in maternal outcomes, neonatal mortality and morbidity between noncomplicated monochorionic and dichorionic discordant twins.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Busan Paik Hospital, Busan, Republic of Korea. 2 Paik Institute for Clinical Research, Busan Paik Hospital, Inje University, Busan, Republic of Korea.","Yong Hee Park , Young Nam Kim , Do Hwa Im , Da Hyun Kim , Jung Mi Byun , Dae Hoon Jeong , Kyung Bok Lee , Moon Su Sung ",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,2021 Jul,"Birth Weight,Chorion,Female,Humans,Infant Mortality,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Pregnancy, Twin*,Twins, Dizygotic*,Twins, Monozygotic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31416367
109,The distinctive sleep pattern of the human calcarine cortex: a stereo-electroencephalographic study,"Study objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) features of sleep in the human calcarine cortex, comparing them with the well-established pattern of the parietal cortex. Methods: We analyzed presurgical intracerebral EEG activity in calcarine and parietal cortices during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in seven patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The time course of the EEG spectral power and NREM vs REM differences was assessed. Sleep spindles were automatically detected. To assess homeostatic dynamics, we considered the first vs second half of the night ratio in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) and the rise rate of delta activity during the first sleep cycle. Results: While the parietal area showed the classically described NREM and REM sleep hallmarks, the calcarine cortex exhibited a distinctive pattern characterized by: (1) the absence of sleep spindles; (2) a large similarity between EEG power spectra of NREM and REM; and (3) reduced signs of homeostatic dynamics, with a decreased delta ratio between the first and the second half of the night, a reduced rise rate of delta activity during the first NREM sleep cycle, and lack of correlation between these measures. Conclusions: Besides describing for the first time the peculiar sleep EEG pattern in the human calcarine cortex, our findings provide evidence that different cortical areas may exhibit specific sleep EEG pattern, supporting the view of sleep as a local process and promoting the idea that the functional role of sleep EEG features should be considered at a regional level.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Rome, Italy. 2 Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences ""Luigi Sacco,"" University of Milan, Milan, Italy. 3 C.

110,Mitochondrial Targeting of Herbal Medicine in Chronic Kidney Disease,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common progressive disease that is typically characterized by the permanent loss of nephrons and an eventual decline in glomerular filtration rate. CKD increases mortality and has a significant impact on the quality of life and the economy, which is becoming a major public health issue worldwide. Since current conventional-medicine treatment options for CKD are not satisfactory, many patients seek complementary and alternative medicine treatments including Traditional Chinese Medicine. Herbal medicine is often used to relieve symptoms of renal diseases in the clinic. The kidney is abundant in the number of mitochondria, which provide enough energy for renal function and metabolism. In recent years, a vital role for mitochondrial dysfunction has been suggested in CKD. Mitochondria have become a new target for the treatment of diseases. A growing number of studies have demonstrated herbal medicine could restore mitochondrial function and alleviate renal injury both in vivo and in vitro. In this review, we sum up the therapeutic effect of herbal medicine in CKD via targeting mitochondrial function. This implies future strategies in preventing CKD.","Affiliation 1 Department of Nephrology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.","Qing Li , Changying Xing , Yanggang Yuan ",Front Pharmacol,2021 May 26,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34122064
111,Effect of adenomyosis on adverse obstetrical outcomes in twin pregnancies achieved with assisted reproductive technology,"The incidence of twin pregnancy with adenomyosis (AD) is increasing due to advanced maternal age and infertility treatment. We retrospectively analysed the data of 45 dichorionic twin pregnancies complicated with AD in contrast to a control group of dichorionic twin pregnancies without AD (n = 130). Compared with those in the control group, the AD group had a higher overall foetal loss rate (8.9% vs. 0.8%; adjusted p = .031; odds ratio (OR), 13.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.27-146.3), higher early preterm delivery rate (20% vs. 6.9%; adjusted p = .007; OR, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.47-12.13) and higher rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (26.7% vs. 7.7%; adjusted p = .005; OR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.5-10.2). Patients in the AD group were significantly more likely to require transfusion during or after delivery (17.8% vs. 5.4%; p = .026) and have smaller babies (2168 g vs. 2399 g; p = .004) compared with those in the control group. This is the first study to report that twin pregnancies with AD may be treated as high-risk for placental dysfunction and may need closer monitoring during pregnancy.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? The incidence of twin pregnancy with adenomyosis (AD) is increasing due to advanced maternal age and infertility treatment. However, there are very few studies on the effect of AD on pregnancy outcomes.What the results of this study add? This is the first study to report that twin pregnancies with AD have higher rates of early preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and transfusion compared to controls.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The results of this study can be used in counselling twin pregnancies with AD. Further research is needed to confirm the current findings.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, CHA Bundang Medical Center, Seongnam-si, Republic of Korea.","Mi Sun Kim , Ji Hyon Jang , Seulgee Park , Eun Hee Ahn , Sang Hee Jung ",J Obstet Gynaecol,2021 Nov,"Adenomyosis / complications*,Adult,Blood Transfusion / statistics & numerical data,Case-Control Studies,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / epidemiology*,Pregnancy Complications / etiology,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology*,Pregnancy, Twin*,Premature Birth / epidemiology,Premature Birth / etiology,Prenatal Care / statistics & numerical data,Reproductive Techniques, Assisted,Retrospective Studies,Twins, Dizygotic*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33890530
112,Explainable Sleep Stage Classification with Multimodal Electrophysiology Time-series,"Many automated sleep staging studies have used deep learning approaches, and a growing number of them have used multimodal data to improve their classification performance. However, few studies using multimodal data have provided model explainability. Some have used traditional ablation approaches that ""zero out"" a modality. However, the samples that result from this ablation are unlikely to be found in real electroencephalography (EEG) data, which could adversely affect the importance estimates that result. Here, we train a convolutional neural network for sleep stage classification with EEG, electrooculograms (EOG), and electromyograms (EMG) and propose an ablation approach that replaces each modality with values that approximate the line-related noise commonly found in electrophysiology data. The relative importance that we identify for each modality is consistent with sleep staging guidelines, with EEG being important for most sleep stages and EOG being important for Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and non-REM stages. EMG showed low relative importance across classes. A comparison of our approach with a ""zero out"" ablation approach indicates that while the importance results are consistent for the most part, our method accentuates the importance of modalities to the model for the classification of some stages like REM (p < 0.05). These results suggest that a careful, domain-specific selection of an ablation approach may provide a clearer indicator of modality importance. Further, this study provides guidance for future research on using explainability methods with multimodal electrophysiology data.Clinical Relevance- While explainability is helpful for clinical machine learning classifiers, it is important to consider how explainability methods interact with clinical data, a domain for which they were not originally designed.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Charles A Ellis, Rongen Zhang, Darwin A Carbajal, Robyn L Miller, Vince D Calhoun, May D Wang",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,2021 Nov,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Electrooculography,Electrophysiology,Polysomnography,Sleep Stages*,Sleep*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891757
113,Parental Socialization of Emotion and Psychophysiological Arousal Patterns in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at considerable risk for difficulties with emotion regulation and related functioning. Although it is commonly accepted that parents contribute to adaptive child regulation, as indexed by observable child behavior, theory and recent evidence suggest that parenting may also influence relevant underlying child physiological tendencies. The current study examined concurrent associations between two elements of parental socialization of emotion and measures of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity in 61 children with ASD aged 6 to 10 years. To index parental socialization, parents reported on their reactions to their children's negative emotions, and parental scaffolding was coded from a dyadic problem-solving task. Children's baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), electrodermal reactivity (EDA-R), and RSA reactivity in response to challenge were obtained as measures of the children's physiological activity. Regression analyses indicated that supportive parent reactions were related to higher child baseline RSA, a biomarker of regulatory capacity. Fewer unsupportive parent reactions and higher quality scaffolding were associated with higher EDA-R, a physiological index of inhibition. The identification of these concurrent associations represents a first step in understanding the complex and likely bidirectional interplay between parent socialization and child physiological reactivity and regulation in this high-risk population.","Affiliations 1 California State University, Fullerton, USA. jmm678@miami.edu. 2 California State University, Fullerton, USA. 3 Auburn University, Auburn, USA. 4 University of Miami, Miami, USA.","Jacquelyn M Moffitt , Jason K Baker , Rachel M Fenning , Stephen A Erath , Daniel S Messinger , Sasha M Zeedyk , Sarah A Paez , Sydney Seel ",Res Child Adolesc Psychopathol,2021 Mar,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Arousal,Autism Spectrum Disorder*,Child,Emotions,Humans,Parenting,Parents,Socialization*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33459921
114,Early pregnancy loss incidence in high-income settings: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Early pregnancy loss (unintended pregnancy loss before 20 completed weeks of gestation) is a common adverse pregnancy outcome, with previous evidence reporting incidence ranging from 10 to 30% of detected pregnancies. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the incidence and range of early pregnancy loss in contemporary pregnant populations based on studies with good internal and external validity. Findings may be useful for clinical counseling in pre-conception and family planning settings and for people who experience early pregnancy loss. Methods: We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases using combinations of medical subject headings and keywords. Peer-reviewed, full-text original research articles that meet the following criteria will be included: (1) human study; (2) study designs: controlled clinical trials or observational studies with at least 100 pregnancies in the denominator, or systematic reviews of studies using these designs; (3) conducted in high-income countries; (4) reporting early pregnancy loss incidence, defined as unintended early pregnancy loss occurring prior to 20 weeks' gestation expressed as the number of losses among all pregnancies in the study period; (5) among a contemporary (1990 or later) general population of pregnancies; and (6) published between January 1, 1990, and August 31, 2021. We will assess the quality of included studies according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force Criteria for Assessing Internal and External Validity of Individual Studies. If appropriate, based on methodological comparability across included studies, we will conduct meta-analyses using random effects models to estimate the pooled incidence of early pregnancy loss among all studies with both good internal and external validity, with meta-analyses stratified by study design type (survey-based or self-reported and medical record-based), by induced abortion restrictions (restricted vs. unrestricted), and by gestational age (first trimester only vs. all gestational ages before 20 weeks). Discussion: This systematic review will synthesize existing evidence to calculate a current estimate of early pregnancy loss incidence and variability in reported incidence estimates in high-income settings. The findings of this review may inform updates to clinical counseling in pre-conception and family planning settings, as well as for patients experiencing early pregnancy loss.

115,Sicherer Babyschlaf: Europäische Empfehlungen auf dem Prüfstand,"das ""Bed-sharing"", mitunter auch als ""Co-sleeping"" bezeichnet, also der gemeinsame Schlaf von Mutter/Vater und Kind (<1 Jahr) im gleichen Bett, gilt - unter anderem wegen der drohenden Behinderung der freien Atmung - als Risikofaktor für den plötzlichen Säuglingstod, sodass in vielen Empfehlungen zum ""sicheren Babyschlaf"" mehr oder weniger pauschal davon abgeraten wird. Dies steht in gewissem Kontrast zu der Tatsache, dass das Bed-sharing weltweit enorm verbreitet ist, und lässt vielleicht auch andere Faktoren, wie die Rolle des kindlichen Alters oder die Auswirkungen auf die mütterliche Stillbereitschaft, zu sehr außer Acht. In einer interessanten Übersichtsarbeit im ""Fokus Hebammenwissenschaft"" dieser Zeitschrift werden daher die Empfehlungen zur Prophylaxe des Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in Europäischen Ländern mit besonders niedriger (Griechenland, Italien, Niederlande) und besonders hoher SIDS-Inzidenz (UK, Österreich, Frankreich) analysiert und der aktuellen Evidenzlage gegenübergestellt.

116,Pregnancy Loss After Amniocentesis with Double-Needle Insertions in Twin Pregnancies,"The aim of this study was to determine the pregnancy loss rate of amniocentesis with double-needle insertions in twin pregnancies. This was a retrospective study of twin pregnancies who underwent amniocentesis with double-needle insertion between 2010 and 2019 at a single center. The pregnancy loss rates were recorded as single or double fetal loss before 24 weeks' gestation and within 4 weeks after the procedure. Risk factors for pregnancy loss after amniocentesis were also assessed. A total of 678 twin pregnancies with amniocentesis were finally included. The pregnancy loss rates before 24 weeks' gestation and within 4 weeks after the procedure were 0.9% and 1.9%, respectively. Only one fetal loss was presumed to be a direct result of the procedure. All other cases were complicated by structural or chromosomal anomalies. Twin pregnancies with abnormal ultrasound findings had a significantly higher rate of pregnancy loss with a relative risk of 4.81 (95% CI [1.03, 22.2]). Our study showed a low pregnancy loss rate after amniocentesis in twin pregnancies with double-needle insertions technique of sampling, which can help decision making in prenatal screening and diagnosis for twin pregnancies.","Affiliation 1 Shanghai Key Laboratory of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Department of Fetal Medicine & Prenatal Diagnosis Center, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.","Luyao Cai # , Yingjun Yang # , Gang Zou , Yun Zhang , Fengyu Wu , Meizhen Yuan , Yan Zhou , Jianping Chen , Luming Sun ",Twin Res Hum Genet,2022 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Abortion, Spontaneous* / epidemiology,Abortion, Spontaneous* / genetics,Amniocentesis* / adverse effects,Amniocentesis* / methods,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35249587
117,Sleep restriction alters physiological and emotional responses to emotion induction,"New findings: What is the central question of this study? The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of sleep restriction on self-report and autonomic responses to neutral and sad film clips. What is the main finding and its importance? Ratings of sadness and heart rate deceleration were greater while watching the sad clip, with no effect of sleep restriction, whereas heart rate variability and skin conductance were impacted by sleep restriction and, to a lesser extent, by film clips. The results suggest that autonomic function was adaptively altered by sleep restriction, in order to maintain a 'normal' response to emotional cues, despite mounting fatigue. Abstract: Habitual insufficient sleep has long-term health consequences via its impact on autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and on regulation of emotion. To our knowledge, the effects of insufficient sleep on emotion-induced ANS function have not been tested. The present study aimed to address this lacuna. Using an emotion induction procedure, the effects of sleep restriction on physiological responses to validated neutral and sad film clips were assessed in a two-by-two, pseudo-randomized, cross-over design. Thirty-one participants, aged 20-33 years, were assessed after sleeping for either 5 h (sleep restricted, SR) or 8 h (well rested, WR) per night, for three consecutive nights. Physiological measures included heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance response (SCR) and participants' ratings of affect and fatigue. There was no effect of sleep conditions on self-reported negative affect, but watching the sad clip reduced self-reported fatigue in the SR condition. There was greater heart rate deceleration while watching sad relative to neutral clips, independent of the sleep condition. Sleep restriction increased heart rate variability measures, with no effect of emotion induction. There was an interaction of emotion induction with sleep condition for SCR, with more SCRs to sad relative to neutral clips in the WR condition, and the opposite effect in the SR condition. Combined, the results suggest that the ANS response to an emotional cue was altered by sleep restriction. The results suggest an adaptive ANS response to mild, chronic sleep restriction, resulting in constant heart rate response and self-reported experience across WR and SR conditions, despite mounting fatigue.","Affiliations 1 Psychology Department, Tel Hai Academic College, Tel Hai, Israel. 2 Psychiatry Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 3 School of Behavioral Sciences, Tel Aviv Yafo Academic College, Tel Aviv, MI, Israel.","Ilana S Hairston , Mairav Cohen-Zion ",Exp Physiol,2020 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Autonomic Nervous System / pathology,Emotions / physiology*,Fatigue / physiopathology,Female,Heart Rate / physiology,Humans,Male,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Deprivation / physiopathology,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33090597
118,"Role of progesterone, cerclage and pessary in preventing preterm birth in twin pregnancies: A systematic review and network meta-analysis","Objective: To determine the role of progesterone, pessary and cervical cerclage in reducing the risk of (preterm birth) PTB in twin pregnancies and compare these interventions using pairwise and network meta-analysis. Study design: Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were explored. The inclusion criteria were studies in which twin pregnancies were randomized to an intervention for the prevention of PTB (any type of progesterone, cervical cerclage, cervical pessary, or any combination of these) or to a control group (e.g. placebo or treatment as usual). Interventions of interest were either progesterone [vaginal or oral natural progesterone or intramuscular 17a-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC)], cerclage (McDonald or Shirodkar), or cervical pessary. The primary outcome was PTB < 34 weeks of gestation. Both primary and secondary outcomes were explored in an unselected population of twin pregnancies and in women at higher risk of PTB (defined as those with cervical length <25 mm). Random-effect head-to-head and a multiple-treatment meta-analyses were used to analyze the data and results expressed as risk ratios. Results: 26 studies were included in the meta-analysis. When considering an unselected population of twin pregnancies, vaginal progesterone, intra-muscular17-OHPC or pessary did not reduce the risk of PTB < 34 weeks of gestation (all p > 0.05). When stratifying the analysis for spontaneous PTB, neither pessary, vaginal or intramuscular 17-OHPC were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PTB compared to controls (all p > 0.05), while there was no study on cerclage which explored this outcome in an unselected population of twin pregnancies. When considering twin pregnancies with short cervical length (≤25 mm), there was no contribution of either pessary, vaginal progesterone, intra-muscular 17-OHPC or cerclage in reducing the risk of overall PTB < 34 weeks of gestation. Conclusions: Cervical pessary, progesterone and cerclage do not show a significant effect in reducing the rate of PTB or perinatal morbidity in twins, either when these interventions are applied to an unselected population of twins or in pregnancies with a short cervix.","Affiliations 1 Center for High-Risk Pregnancy and Fetal Care, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Chieti, Chieti, Italy.

119,Effect of music on labor and delivery in nulliparous singleton pregnancies: a randomized clinical trial,"Background: Women's experience of pain during labor varies greatly, and pain control is a major concern for obstetricians. Several methods have been studied for pain management for women in labor, including drug and non-drug interventions. Objective: To test the hypothesis that in nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies at term, listening to music would reduce the pain level during labor. Methods: Parallel group non-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted at a single center in Italy. Nulliparous women in spontaneous labor with singleton pregnancies and vertex presentation admitted in labor and delivery room between 37 0/7 and 42 0/7 weeks of gestation for active phase of labor were eligible, and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive music during labor or no music during labor. Music in labor was defined listening to music from the randomization until the delivery of the baby. The primary endpoint was the pain level during the active phase of labor, recorded using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain). The effect of music use during labor on each outcome was quantified as the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: During the study period, 30 women agree to take part in the study, underwent randomization, and were enrolled and followed up. 15 women were randomized in the music group, and 15 in the control group. No patients were lost to follow up for the primary outcome. Pain level during the active phase of labor was scored 8.8 ± 0.9 in the music group, and 9.8 ± 0.3 in the control group (MD - 1.00 point, 95% CI - 1.48 to - 0.52; P < 0.01). Music during labor and delivery was also associated with a decreased pain at 1 h postpartum (MD - 2.40 points, 95% CI - 4.30 to - 0.50), and decreased anxiety level during active phase of labor (MD - 19.90 points, 95% CI - 38.72 to - 1.08), second stage of labor (MD - 49.40 points, 95% CI - 69.44 to - 29.36), and at 1 h postpartum (MD - 27.00 points, 95% CI - 47.37 to - 6.63). Conclusion: In nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies at term, listening to music reduces the pain level, and the anxiety level during labor.

120,"Parental eating disorders: A systematic review of parenting attitudes, behaviours, and parent-child interactions","A substantial proportion of adults with eating disorders are parents. Studies suggest these parents may experience a range of parenting challenges, and their children may be at an increased risk for the development of eating disorders themselves. With parenting practices being one potential environmental mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of eating disorders, we systematically searched Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and PsychArticles for controlled studies in which parenting attitudes, behaviours, and parent-child interactions were examined for parents with and without probable eating disorders. 26,512 abstracts were screened, and 167 full-text manuscripts were retrieved, with 33 studies meeting the review inclusion criteria. Studies suggest that parents with eating disorders experience higher levels of parenting stress than control parents, and may on average be more intrusive, less sensitive, and provide less structuring/facilitation in non-feeding interactions with their children. These parents also appear, on average, to experience increased concern about their children's weight, and parent-child mealtime interactions may be problematic and characterised by high levels of conflict. Suggestions for future research are made with a view to enhancing understandings of the intergenerational transmission of eating disorders, which may lead to the identification of intervention targets for parents with eating disorders and their children.","Affiliations 1 School of Psychology, University of Sussex, United Kingdom.

121,Anatomy and Physiology of the Breast during Pregnancy and Lactation,"The mature breast is located within the anterior thoracic wall, lying atop the pectoralis major muscle. Pubertal changes lead to incomplete development of the breast , a process which is only completed during pregnancy . The incomplete breast consists mostly of adipose tissue but also lactiferous units called lobes. These eventually drain into the lactiferous ducts and then into the lactiferous sinus and then to the nipple-areolar complex. During pregnancy , the breast undergoes both anatomic and physiologic changes to prepare for lactation. During the first trimester, the ductal system expands and branches out into the adipose tissue in response to the increase of estrogen. Elevated levels of estrogen also cause a decrease in adipose tissue and ductal proliferation and elongation. Estrogen also stimulates the pituitary gland which leads to elevated levels of prolactin. By the twentieth week of gestation, mammary glands are sufficiently developed to produce components of milk due to prolactin stimulation. Milk production is inhibited by high estrogen and progesterone levels and colostrum is produced during this time. In the third trimester and then rapidly after birth, these levels decrease, allowing for milk production and eventual let-down to allow for breastfeeding. Most pregnancies cause the areola to darken, the breast to increase in size, and the Montgomery glands to become more prominent. Post-lactational involution occurs at the cessation of milk production caused by a decline in prolactin.","Affiliations 1 Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University/Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA. 2 Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University/Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, VA, USA. kandace.mcguire@vcuhealth.org.","Ashley Alex , Eva Bhandary , Kandace P McGuire ",Adv Exp Med Biol,2020,"Review,Breast / anatomy & histology*,Breast / physiology*,Estrogens,Female,Humans,Lactation / physiology*,Milk, Human,Parturition,Pregnancy / physiology*,Prolactin,Estrogens,Prolactin",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32816256
122,Patterns of physical activity parenting practices among parent-adolescent dyads who participated in a cross-sectional internet-based study,"Background: While research exploring relationships between individual parenting practices and child physical activity (PA) exists, little is known about simultaneous use of practices. Hence, study objectives were to determine patterns of PA parenting practices and their associations with demographic, anthropometric, and PA measures in a large sample of parents and their adolescent children (12-17 years). Methods: Dyadic survey data from Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE), a cross-sectional, internet-based study, conducted in 2014 were analyzed using latent class analysis on 5 PA parenting practices - pressuring, guided choice, expectations, facilitation, and modeling. Self-report model covariates included adolescent age and parent and adolescent sex, body mass index category (based on height and weight), legitimacy of parental authority regarding PA (PA-LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Results: Based on 1166 parent-adolescent dyads, four latent classes were identified representing a continuum of practice use (high to low) - Complete Influencers (26%), Facilitating-Modeling Influencers (23%), Pressuring-Expecting Influencers (25%), and Indifferent Influencers (27%). Compared to dyads with parent underweight/healthy weight, dyads with parent overweight/obesity had 84% higher odds of belonging to Indifferent Influencers. Compared to dyads with adolescent underweight/healthy weight, dyads with adolescent overweight/obesity had 50 and 46% lower odds of belonging to Facilitating-Modeling and Indifferent Influencers. Odds of belonging to Pressuring-Expecting and Indifferent Influencers were less than 1% lower for every 1 min/day increase in parent MVPA and 2 and 4% lower for every 1 min/day increase in adolescent MVPA. Compared to dyads with high parental and adolescent agreement with PA-LPA, dyads with low agreement had between 3 and 21 times the odds of belonging to Facilitating-Modeling, Pressuring-Expecting, or Indifferent Influencers. Conclusions: Findings suggest that parents utilize distinct patterns of PA practices ranging from use of many, use of some, to low use of any practice and these patterns are differentially associated with parent and adolescent PA. When planning PA interventions, a counseling or intervening approach with parents to use combinations of practices, like facilitation and modeling, to positively influence their adolescents' and possibly their own participation in PA may prove more efficacious than parental pressuring or lack of practice use.","Affiliations 1 US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 141 Experiment Station Road, Stoneville, MS, 38776, USA. jessica.thomson@usda.gov. 2 Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, University of Central Arkansas, McAlister 112, 201 Donaghey Avenue, Conway, AR, 72035, USA. 3 US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, 141 Experiment Station Road, Stoneville, MS, 38776, USA.","Jessica L Thomson , Alicia S Landry , Tameka I Walls ",BMC Public Health,2021 Jun 29,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Adolescent,Child,Cross-Sectional Studies,Exercise,Health Behavior*,Humans,Internet,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34187459

This study surveyed 486 parents of children with disability in China to understand the role of social support between parenting stress and parents' resilience. The results indicated that the resilience of Chinese parents of children with disabilities was at a high level. Additionally, parenting stress, social support and resilience were significantly associated, and the mediating effect of social support between parenting stress and parents' resilience were proved by mediation analyses. The findings suggested that reducing parental stress and improving social support may predict (or be associated with) improved parent resilience.

124,Risk Factors and Birth Outcomes Associated with Teenage Pregnancy: A Canadian Sample,"Study objective: To examine the extent to which socioeconomic status, mental health, and substance use are associated with teenage pregnancies in Southwestern Ontario (SWO), and whether these pregnancies are at an elevated risk for adverse birth outcomes, after controlling for medical, behavioral, and socioeconomic status factors. Design: Retrospective cohort study using perinatal and neonatal databases. Setting: Tertiary care hospital in SWO. Participants: Women residing in SWO who gave birth to singleton infants without congenital anomalies between 2009 and 2014. Teenage pregnancies (19 years of age or younger) were compared with pregnancies of women 20-34 years and 35 years or older. Interventions: None. Main outcome measures: Low birth weight (LBW), very LBW, term LBW, preterm birth, very preterm birth, low and very low Apgar score, and fetal macrosomia. Results: Of 25,263 pregnant women, 1080 (4.3%) were 19 years of age or younger. Approximately 18% of teenage mothers lived in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, compared with 11% of mothers aged 20-34 and 9% of women 35 years of age or older (P < .001). Teenage mothers had higher rates of depression during pregnancy (9.8%) than mothers 20-34 years (5.8%) and those 35 years of age or older (6.8%; P < .001). Young mothers self-reported higher tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol use during pregnancy than adult mothers (P < .001). Teenage pregnancy increased the risk of a low Apgar score (adjusted odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-2.02), but was not associated with other birth outcomes after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion: Teenage pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of socioeconomic disadvantage, mental health problems, and substance use during pregnancy, but is largely unrelated to adverse birth outcomes in SWO.","Affiliations 1 School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Brescia University College, London, Ontario, Canada. 2 School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Brescia University College, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. 3 Department of Geography, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Human Environments Analysis Laboratory, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Paediatrics, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Children's Health Research Institute/Lawson Health Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada; School of Health Studies, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada. 4 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. 5 School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Brescia University College, London, Ontario, Canada; Human Environments Analysis Laboratory, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Paediatrics, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada; Children's Health Research Institute/Lawson Health Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada.

Two investigators independently performed the literature search, study selection, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, and qualitative data synthesis. Out of 3571 articles identified, 24 articles were included in the systematic review. Main findings include the following: (1) shorter sleep duration is associated with lower macrovascular EF; (2) not sleeping 7-9 h/night is linked with impaired microvascular EF; (3) sleep restriction impairs micro- and macrovascular EF; (4) acute total sleep deprivation impairs micro- and macrovascular EF but data on macrovascular EF are less consistent; and (5) shift work impairs macrovascular EF. In conclusion, sleep deprivation impairs EF, which may explain the link between insufficient sleep and CVD. Future investigations should fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to combat the adverse endothelial effects of sleep deprivation across the lifespan.","Affiliations 1 Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology, College of Health and Human Performance, University of Florida, 1864 Stadium Road, Gainesville, FL, 32611-8205, USA. 2 Department of Health Education and Behavior, College of Health and Human Performance, University of Florida, 1864 Stadium Road, Gainesville, FL, 32611-8205, USA. 3 Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology, College of Health and Human Performance, University of Florida, 1864 Stadium Road, Gainesville, FL, 32611-8205, USA. ddchristou@ufl.edu.","Brady J Holmer , Stephanie S Lapierre , Danielle E Jake-Schoffman , Demetra D Christou ",Geroscience,2021 Feb,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Review,Systematic Review,Aged,Cardiovascular Diseases* / etiology,Humans,Sleep,Sleep Deprivation*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33558966
126,[Does neuroscience understand dreaming?],"Sleep is a succession of two stages: slow-wave and rapid eye-movement sleep. The later has mixed characteristics between sleep and wakefulness. Therefore, dreams have been proposed to occur during this stage. This hypothesis is now considered as oversimplified. Dreaming may occur during the two stages though with different characteristics. Deciphering brain structures associated with dreaming is difficult. However, during the two stages, a decrease in low-frequency and an increase in high-frequency electrical activity in posterior cortical regions has been reported that might be the neural correlate of dreaming. The origin of cortex stimulation is under debate, but the mechanisms involved are similar to those acting during wakefulness. Dream function is not known and it might be an epiphenomenon originating from synaptic transmission noise. Depriving subjects of rapid-eye movement sleep for two weeks has no apparent effect on their behavior.","Affiliation 1 Directeur de recherche émérite CNRS, Université Paris Diderot, Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes, CNRS UMR7057, bâtiment Condorcet, 10 rue Alice Domon et Léonie Duquet, 75013 Paris, France.",Jean-Pierre Henry ,Med Sci (Paris),2020 Oct,"Brain / physiology,Dreams / physiology,Dreams / psychology*,Electroencephalography,Humans,Neurosciences / methods*,Polysomnography,Sleep / physiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33026337
127,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health-care systems and potentially on pregnancy outcomes, but no systematic synthesis of evidence of this effect has been undertaken. We aimed to assess the collective evidence on the effects on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of the pandemic. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 8, 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports comparing maternal and perinatal mortality, maternal morbidity, pregnancy complications, and intrapartum and neonatal outcomes before and during the pandemic. We also planned to record any additional maternal and offspring outcomes identified. Studies of solely SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals, as well as case reports, studies without comparison groups, narrative or systematic literature reviews, preprints, and studies reporting on overlapping populations were excluded. Quantitative meta-analysis was done for an outcome when more than one study presented relevant data. Random-effects estimate of the pooled odds ratio (OR) of each outcome were generated with use of the Mantel-Haenszel method. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211753). Findings: The search identified 3592 citations, of which 40 studies were included. We identified significant increases in stillbirth (pooled OR 1·28 [95% CI 1·07-1·54]; I2=63%; 12 studies, 168 295 pregnancies during and 198 993 before the pandemic) and maternal death (1·37 [1·22-1·53; I2=0%, two studies [both from low-income and middle-income countries], 1 237 018 and 2 224 859 pregnancies) during versus before the pandemic. Preterm births before 37 weeks' gestation were not significantly changed overall (0·94 [0·87-1·02]; I2=75%; 15 studies, 170 640 and 656 423 pregnancies) but were decreased in high-income countries (0·91 [0·84-0·99]; I2=63%; 12 studies, 159 987 and 635 118 pregnancies), where spontaneous preterm birth was also decreased (0·81 [0·67-0·97]; two studies, 4204 and 6818 pregnancies). Mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were higher, indicating poorer mental health, during versus before the pandemic (pooled mean difference 0·42 [95% CI 0·02-0·81; three studies, 2330 and 6517 pregnancies). Surgically managed ectopic pregnancies were increased during the pandemic (OR 5·81 [2·16-15·6]; I2=26%; three studies, 37 and 272 pregnancies). No overall significant effects were identified for other outcomes included in the quantitative analysis: maternal gestational diabetes; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; preterm birth before 34 weeks', 32 weeks', or 28 weeks' gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth; labour induction; modes of delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery, caesarean section, or instrumental delivery); post-partum haemorrhage; neonatal death; low birthweight (<2500 g); neonatal intensive care unit admission; or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min. Interpretation: Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between high-resource and low-resource settings. There is an urgent need to prioritise safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises.

129,Do mothers and fathers agree? Examining interparental ratings of youth externalizing behaviors among ethnically diverse families,"Objective: This study examined the association between youth, parent, and family characteristics in mother-father agreement of youth externalizing behaviors among ethnically diverse families. Method: Eighty-eight mother-father dyads of youth (44% Latino, 38% European-American, 17% African American) 6-16 years participated. Results: Overall associations between parent's reports of youth behavior problems were positively correlated. Significant predictors of parent difference scores in regression analyses included mother's depression scores (negatively), mother and father parenting stress scores (positively and negatively, respectively), and child's symptom severity (positively in the Inattention and Learning Problems models; negatively in the Defiance/Aggression model). Conclusions: Results highlight the need for psychosocial screening of youth's parents during child psychological assessment to identify situations in which both parent reports are needed for youth assessment. Further, it contributes to the small literature base of discrepancies in parent reports in minority youth and expands upon the minimal research involving paternal caregivers.","Affiliations 1 Yale Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. 2 College of Psychology, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA. 3 Division of Behavioral Health, Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.","Areti Vassilopoulos , Christian DeLucia , Cynthia Torres ",J Clin Psychol,2021 Nov,"Adolescent,Caregivers,Child,Fathers,Female,Humans,Male,Mothers*,Parenting,Problem Behavior*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34214193
130,Do animals dream?,"The understanding of biological functions of sleep has improved recently, including an understanding of the deep evolutionary roots of sleep among animals. However, dreaming as an element of sleep may be particularly difficult to address in non-human animals because in humans dreaming involves a non-wakeful form of awareness typically identified through verbal report. Here, we argue that parallels that exist between the phenomenology, physiology, and sleep behaviors during human dreaming provide an avenue to investigate dreaming in non-human animals. We review three alternative measurements of human dreaming - neural correlates of dreaming, 'replay' of newly-acquired memories, and dream-enacting behaviors - and consider how these may be applied to non-human animal models. We suggest that while animals close in brain structure to humans (such as mammals and birds) may be optimal models for the first two of these measurements, cephalopods, especially octopuses, may be particularly good candidates for the third.","Affiliations 1 School of Psychology, University of East London, Stratford, UK.

131,Herbal compounds for rheumatoid arthritis: Literatures review and cheminformatics prediction,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disease characterized by autoimmunity, joint inflammation, and cartilage destruction, which affects 0.5-1% of the population. Many compounds from herbal medicines show the potentials to treat RA. On this basis, the compounds with good pharmacokinetic behaviors and drug-likeness properties will be further studied and developed. Therefore, the herbal compounds with anti-RA activities were reviewed in this paper, and the cheminformatics tools were used to predict their drug-likeness properties and pharmacokinetic parameters. A total of 90 herbal compounds were analyzed, which were reported to be effective on RA models through anti-inflammation, chondroprotection, immunoregulation, antiangiogenesis, and antioxidation. Most of the herbal compounds have good drug-likeness properties. Most of the compounds can be an alternative and valuable source for anti-RA drug discovery.","Affiliation 1 College of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guian New Area, PR China.","Xu-Zhao Li , Shuai-Nan Zhang ",Phytother Res,2020 Jan,"Review,Arthritis, Rheumatoid / drug therapy*,Cheminformatics / methods*,Chronic Disease,Female,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Plants, Medicinal / chemistry*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31515874
132,Identification of the sleep-wake states in rats using the high-frequency activity of the electroencephalogram,"The electroencephalographic signal constitutes the main sign classically used for the identification of states of alertness. However, activities in the high frequency (>100 Hz) range have not been properly studied despite their high potential for sleep scoring in rodents. In the present study, we designed a method for the identification of the sleep-wake states in rats by exclusively using high-frequency activities of the electroencephalogram. By calculating the ratio between the amplitude of the electroencephalographic signal from 110 to 200 Hz and from 110 to 300 Hz, we obtained an index that had values that were low during wakefulness, intermediate during non-REM sleep and high during REM sleep. This high-frequency index (HiFI) allowed the identification of each state without the need to study other signs such as muscle activity or eye movements. To evaluate the performance of the index, we compared it with the conventional scoring of the sleep-wake cycle based upon the study of the electromyogram and delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (6-9 Hz) and sigma (10-14 Hz) bands of the electroencephalogram. The index had an accuracy of 90.43 ± 1.91% (Cohen's kappa value of 0.82), confirming that the study of the high-frequency activities of the electroencephalogram was sufficient to reliably identify alertness states in the rat. Compared to other sleep-scoring methods, the HiFI has several advantages. It only requires one electroencephalography electrode, thus reducing the severity of the surgical preparation of the experimental animal, and its calculation is very simple, so it can be easily implemented online to classify sleep-wake states in real time.","Affiliations 1 Department of Physiology, Faculty of Biology, University of Seville, Seville, Spain. 2 Department of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.","Manuel Silva-Pérez , Alvaro Sánchez-López , Natalia Pompa-Del-Toro , Miguel Escudero ",J Sleep Res,2021 Aug,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Electroencephalography*,Electromyography,Female,Male,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep, REM,Wakefulness / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33200511

134,Comparing two measures of sleep depth/intensity,"Study objectives: To compare delta spectral power (delta) and odds ratio product (ORP) as measures of sleep depth during sleep restriction with placebo or a drug that increases delta. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from a study of 41 healthy participants randomized to receive placebo or gaboxadol 15 mg during sleep restriction. Participants underwent in-laboratory sleep studies on two baseline, four sleep restriction (5-h), and two recovery nights. Relation between delta or ORP and sleep depth was operationally defined as the degree of association of each metric to the probability of arousal or awakening occurring during the next 30 s (arousability). Results: ORP values in wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM were significantly different. Delta differed between both N2 and N3 and other sleep stages but not between wake and N1 or N1 and REM. Epoch-by-epoch and individual correlations between ORP and delta power were modest or insignificant. The relation between ORP and arousability was linear across the entire ORP range. Delta also changed with arousability but only when delta values were less than 300 μV2. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis found the ability to predict imminent arousal to be significantly greater with ORP than with log delta power for all experimental conditions. Changes in ORP, but not log delta, across the night correlated with next-day physiologic sleep tendency. Conclusions: Compared to delta power, ORP is more discriminating among sleep stages, more sensitive to sleep restriction, and more closely associated with arousability. This evidence supports ORP as a measure of sleep depth/intensity.","Affiliations 1 Sleep Disorders Centre, Misericordia Health Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. 2 Sleep Medicine & Research Center, St. Luke's Hospital, Chesterfield, MO. 3 Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Rady Faculty of Health Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.","Magdy Younes , Paula K Schweitzer , Kara S Griffin , Robert Balshaw , James K Walsh ",Sleep,2020 Dec 14,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Arousal,Electroencephalography*,Humans,Polysomnography*,Sleep Stages,Sleep*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32729619
135,Fetal gender and umbilical cord characteristics at birth,"Objective: To determine fetal gender on umbilical cord parameters. Methods: Umbilical cords were prospectively collected from uncomplicated, singleton, term pregnancies, which ended either by elective cesarean section or spontaneous vaginal delivery. Data regarding obstetrical history and pregnancy outcome were collected. Various cord parameters were examined including, length, number of coils, umbilical cord index (UCI), which demonstrate the ratio between number of coils and cord length, site of placental insertion, direction of coiling and the presence of true knots. Results: Overall, 154 umbilical cords were collected, of them 84 from male and 70 from female newborns. No differences were found regarding obstetrical history parameters or pregnancy outcome between the groups. The umbilical coiling index was significantly higher in female compared to male newborns (0.183 coils/cm versus 0.157 coils/cm, p=.006) due to higher number of cord coils (12.25 ± 5.31 vs. 10.17 ± 3.96, p=.007), with no difference in cord length (66.48 vs. 64.61 cm, p=.372). These differences remained statistically significant even after correction for gravidity, parity and gestational age using multiple linear regression analysis. Conclusion: Female newborns having higher umbilical cord index, compared to male as a result of more coils, with no length dissimilarity.","Affiliation 1 Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Lis Maternity Hospital, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.","Yifat Ochshorn , Jessica Ascher Landsberg , Ariel Many , Sharon Maslovitz , Eli Rimon , Yariv Yogev ",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,2021 Aug,"Cesarean Section*,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Male,Parturition,Placenta*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Umbilical Cord",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31510828
136,"Sleep in older adolescents. Results from a large cross-sectional, population-based study","The aim of the present study was to describe sleep patterns in a large and representative sample of Norwegian adolescents. The sample included 4,010 first-year high school students, aged 16-17 years (54% female), who completed a web-based survey on sleep patterns. The process of going to sleep was addressed as a two-step sequence of (a) shuteye latency (interval from bedtime to shuteye time) and (b) sleep onset latency (interval from shuteye time to sleep onset). Results showed that 84.8% of the adolescents failed to obtain the recommended amount of sleep (8+ h) on schooldays, and 49.4% obtained less than 7 h. Mean bedtime on schooldays was 10:33 PM, with rise time 8:19 h later (time in bed). The adolescents reported long school-day shuteye latency (43 min), limiting sleep opportunity to 7:36 h. Sleep onset latency was 32 min and mean school-day sleep duration was only 6:43 h. On free days, 26.3% of the adolescents obtained less than 8 h of sleep, and 11.7% obtained less than 7 h. Mean bedtime was 00:33 AM, time in bed was 10:35 h, shuteye latency was 39 min and sleep onset latency was 24 min. Mean free-day sleep duration was 8:38 h. There were sex differences in several sleep parameters, including shuteye latency. The results indicate that the majority of Norwegian adolescents fail to obtain the recommended amount of sleep (8+ h) on schooldays. Long shuteye latency appears to be a main driver for short school-day sleep duration in adolescents.","Affiliations 1 Norwegian Competence Center for Sleep Disorders, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. 2 Centre for Sleep Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. 3 Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. 4 Department of Psychosocial Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. 5 Department of Health Promotion, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Bergen, Norway. 6 Department of Research and Innovation, Helse Fonna HF, Bergen, Norway. 7 Department of Mental Health, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Bergen, Norway. 8 School of Psychology, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia. 9 Optentia Research Focus Area, North-West University, Vanderbijlpark Campus, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.","Ingvild West Saxvig , Bjørn Bjorvatn , Mari Hysing , Børge Sivertsen , Michael Gradisar , Ståle Pallesen ",J Sleep Res,2021 Aug,"Adolescent,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Male,Norway,Sex Characteristics,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,Sleep Latency,Surveys and Questionnaires,Time Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33350033
137,Are the voices of parents heard? A scoping review of satisfaction in parenting programs,"Parenting programs are an effective approach to promote positive parenting. In evidence-based practice, client's values and preferences contribute to promoting quality, and are a crucial component of service evaluation. The current scoping review summarizes quantitative research that examines parental satisfaction with parent training for families with child conduct problems. We aimed to know how much research had been undertaken; what measures have been used; and what were the findings related to parental satisfaction. A scoping review was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed original articles. Out of 420 papers 5.5 % obtained data on parental satisfaction. Seven different measures were used, mainly Therapy Attitude Inventory and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. Out of 23 papers, ten studies reported Cronbach's alpha coefficients on the assessment that was used to evaluate parental satisfaction. All of the 23 included studies found that parents are very satisfied with the parenting program they have received. The findings indicate that only a few studies included parents' values and preferences in quantitative evaluation studies on parental programs. In addition, there is a limited arsenal of assessment tools to measure what matters to parents. There is a need to develop measures with high psychometric quality, which will promote more quality in service evaluation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Health Promotion and Development, The Faculty of Psychology, University of Bergen, Norway.

138,Video-feedback promotes sensitive limit-setting in parents of twin preschoolers: a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Primary aim of the current randomized controlled trial was to test the effectiveness of the parenting intervention 'Video-feedback to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline' (VIPP-SD) in a sample of parents of preschool-aged twins, as well as differential susceptibility to intervention efforts, that is, whether more temperamentally reactive parents would profit more from the VIPP-SD than parents with lower reactivity. Methods: The sample consisted of 202 families with same-sex twins [N = 404 children, mean age 45 months (SD = 6.81)]. Randomization was done at the family level in a 2:3 ratio, with 83 families (41%) randomized to the VIPP-SD group, and 119 families (59%) to the control group. After two pre-tests in year 1 and year 2 of the study, the VIPP-SD was implemented in the third year, with a post-test assessment 1 month after the five intervention sessions. Parental sensitivity was observed during structured play in which parent and child copied a drawing together in a computerized Etch-A-Sketch paradigm. Parental limit-setting was observed in a 'don't touch' task in which the parent required from the child to abstain from playing with attractive toys. Parents interacted with each of their twins in separate sessions. Results: The VIPP-SD intervention had a positive impact on the level of parents' positive limit-setting in interaction with their preschool twins, and this positive effect was most pronounced when the parents completed at least five intervention sessions. However, the intervention did not enhance parental sensitivity during structured play. Parents with higher reactivity were not more open to the impact of the intervention, thus for this temperamental marker differential susceptibility in adults was not supported. Conclusions: The current study is unique in targeting families with twin preschoolers, providing proof of principle that coaching parents with video-feedback promotes parental sensitive limit-setting to both children. It remains to be seen whether this finding can be replicated in families with non-twin siblings, or other parental susceptibility markers.

139,"Ninjin'yoeito, a herbal medicine, enhances glucose tolerance in mice","The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increases under conditions of obesity but also due to aging. While a variety of treatment options are being explored there are still many unanswered questions about the underlying mechanisms for the aetiology and progression of this illness. Here we show that pre-treatment with Ninjin'yoeito (NYT), a herbal medicine composed of 12 different ingrediencies, before a glucose challenge results in significantly improved glucose tolerance. This occurs in the absence of significant alterations in insulin excursion compared to vehicle treatment, indicating NYT improves insulin responsiveness and/or insulin-independent glucose disposal. Furthermore, we identify Ginseng - one of the 12 ingredients of NYT - as one key component contributing to NYT's effect on glucose clearance. Importantly, lack of Y4 receptor signalling abolishes the positive effects of NYT on glucose tolerance suggesting Y4 receptor-controlled pathways are crucial in mediating this action of NYT. Using c-fos as neuronal activation marker, we show NYT activates the area postrema - a circumventricular organ in the brainstem that expresses high level of Y4 receptors, supporting an involvement of brainstem Y4 signalling in NYT-activated central networks. Together, these data suggest that NYT is a positive influencer of glucose metabolism in insulin-sensitive tissues and the mechanistic actions of NYT include brainstem Y4 circuitries.","Affiliations 1 Neuroscience Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia; St. Vincent's Clinical School, University of NSW, Sydney, Australia.

140,Clinical risk factors for preeclampsia in twin pregnancies,"Background: Preeclampsia is a common obstetric complication. The rate of preeclampsia is increased in twin pregnancies. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical risk factors for developing preeclampsia in twin pregnancies. Methods: A case-control study was carried out among women with twin pregnancies who delivered at gestational age more than 23 weeks at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, from 2003 to 2019. The data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to find the risk factors. Results: A total of 1,568 twin pregnancies were delivered during the study period and 182 cases (11.6%) developed preeclampsia. 172 cases with preeclampsia and 516 controls were selected for analysis. After certain variables were adjusted in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the clinical factors associated with preeclampsia in twin pregnancies were nulliparity (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.41) and chronic hypertension (adjusted OR 6.22, 95%CI 1.98-19.57). Low gestational weight gain was a significant protective factor against the development of preeclampsia (adjusted OR 0.50; 95%CI 0.32-0.77). Conclusion: The clinical risk factors for developing preeclampsia in twin pregnancies were nulliparity and chronic hypertension. These risk factors are of value to identify twin pregnant women at risk for preeclampsia and in implementing primary prevention.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.","Nipp Chantanahom , Vorapong Phupong ",PLoS One,2021 Apr 15,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Case-Control Studies,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Infant, Low Birth Weight,Logistic Models,Maternal Age,Parity,Pre-Eclampsia / epidemiology*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin / statistics & numerical data*,Risk Assessment / methods*,Thailand / epidemiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33857157
141,Effect of a Recliner Chair with Rocking Motions on Sleep Efficiency,"In this study, we analyze the effect of a recliner chair with rocking motions on sleep quality of naps using automated sleep scoring and spindle detection models. The quality of sleep corresponding to the two rocking motions was measured quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative evaluation, we conducted a sleep parameter analysis based on the results of the estimated sleep stages obtained on the brainwave and spindle estimation, and a sleep survey assessment from the participants was analyzed for the qualitative evaluation. The analysis showed that sleep in the recliner chair with rocking motions positively increased the duration of the spindles and deep sleep stage, resulting in improved sleep quality.","Affiliations 1 Department of Computer engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul 01897, Korea. 2 Digital Transformation RnD Department, Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, Ansan 15588, Korea. 3 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul 01811, Korea.","Suwhan Baek , Hyunsoo Yu , Jongryun Roh , Jungnyun Lee , Illsoo Sohn , Sayup Kim , Cheolsoo Park ",Sensors (Basel),2021 Dec 8,"Electroencephalography,Humans,Motion,Sleep,Sleep Quality*,Sleep Stages*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960304
142,Changes in Coagulation During Twin Pregnancies,"To investigate changes in coagulation during twin pregnancies. Methods: A total of 108 women with twin pregnancies and 442 women with singleton pregnancies were recruited. Coagulation tests, including fibrinogen (Fib), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT), were performed during the course of the pregnancy. The level of fibrinogen gradually increased during singleton pregnancies, while the APTT and PT levels showed a decreasing trend with increasing gestational weeks. In twin pregnancies, the changes in PT and TT were similar, but other parameters displayed a different trend. Fibrinogen showed no significant difference between the second and third trimesters, while APTT showed an increasing trend from the second trimester to the third trimester. Compared with singleton pregnancies, the level of fibrinogen was higher in women pregnant with twins. APTT was longer in women pregnant with twins than in women with singleton pregnancies in the third trimester. PT was shorter in women pregnant with twins than in women with singleton pregnancies in the first and third trimesters. TT was shorter in women pregnant with twins than in women with singleton pregnancies in the first and second trimesters. Through this retrospective longitudinal analysis, this study presents the main coagulation parameter changes in singleton and twin pregnancies and confirms that coagulation is more enhanced in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. 2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.","Ke Ren , Yuan Wei , Rui Qiao , Huifeng Shi , Xiaoli Gong , Yangyu Zhao ",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,2020 Jan-Dec,"Adult,Blood Coagulation Tests,Blood Coagulation*,Female,Fibrinogen / analysis,Humans,Partial Thromboplastin Time,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Prothrombin Time,Retrospective Studies,Fibrinogen",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33372546
143,Parental behavior across Nepali schools' parents and children demographic characteristics,"This study aims to explore parental behavior with its dimensions: Parental involvement, consistency in disciplinary behavior, monitoring and supervision, and punishing behavior, and also examine the difference across the parents and child demographic characteristics. The data were collected from 644 children of Grade 10 from 20 schools using the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha was in the range of .7 that would ensure the internal consistency of the questionnaire. From the analysis of data using mean, and SD, t-test, and analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test, the major findings were that the parents exhibit almost frequently positive parental involvement in their children's study, however, they show inconsistent disciplinary behavior and poor monitoring, and almost rarely use the corporal punishment. The study concludes that parental behavior across parents and children demographic characteristics is imperative for policymakers and practitioners to be realistic while preparing and implementing the educational plans and policies.","Affiliation 1 Faculty of Social Sciences and Education, Nepal Open University, Manbhawan, Lalitpur, Nepal.",Jiban Khadka ,J Community Psychol,2021 Sep,"Child,Demography,Humans,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents*,Schools",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33450078
144,Exposure to relaxing words during sleep promotes slow-wave sleep and subjective sleep quality,"Our thoughts alter our sleep, but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. We propose that mental processes are active to a greater or lesser extent during sleep and that this degree of activation affects our sleep depth. We examined this notion by activating the concept of ""relaxation"" during sleep using relaxation-related words in 50 healthy participants. In support of our hypothesis, playing relaxing words during non-rapid eye movement sleep extended the time spent in slow-wave sleep, increased power in the slow-wave activity band after the word cue, and abolished an asymmetrical sleep depth during the word presentation period. In addition, participants reported a higher sleep quality and elevated subjective alertness. Our results support the notion that the activation of mental concepts during sleep can influence sleep depth. They provide a basis for interventions using targeted activations to promote sleep depth and sleep quality to foster well-being and health.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland. 2 The Siesta Group Schlafanalyse GmbH, Vienna, Austria.","Jonas Beck , Erna Loretz , Björn Rasch ",Sleep,2021 Nov 12,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Electroencephalography,Humans,Sleep / physiology,Sleep Quality,Sleep, Slow-Wave*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34115139
145,Editorial Perspective: Adolescents' fragile sleep-shining light on a time of risk to mental health,"As many other facets of life-biological, behavioral, psychological, cognitive, and social-undergo change during adolescence, so too does sleep. The context of sleep behavior is modified by alterations to underlying bioregulatory processes that challenge sleep's timing, regularity, and quantity. The buildup of sleep pressure during the day gets slower, opening the door for youth to stay awake later; however, the amount of sleep required does not diminish. Further, the circadian timing system delays, again providing the biological impetus for later sleep. When these changes meet societal demands for early wake, most teens cannot find a way to get enough sleep at a consistent time from night to night. Insufficient and irregular sleep provides a fragile foundation to support mental health.","Affiliations 1 E.P.

146,Unilateral twin pregnancy: A non-infectious factor required for the etiological diagnosis of abortion in dairy herds,"Twin pregnancies are classified into bilateral (one fetus in each uterine horn: 44%) and unilateral (both fetuses in the same uterine horn, right or left: 56%). The incidence of abortion during mid- to late gestation is approximately 1% in cows carrying bilateral twins and more than 40% in cows carrying unilateral twins. In this period, abortion seems most commonly associated with infectious agents. However, although this imbalanced abortion rate may imply that unilateral twin pregnancy is a non-infectious abortion factor, few available data can describe the cause of abortions in twin pregnancies. The current findings suggest that unilateral twin pregnancy is a non-infectious factor required for the etiological diagnosis of abortion in dairy herds.","Affiliations 1 Agrotecnio Centre; University of Lleida, 25198 Lleida, Spain. 2 Transfer in Bovine Reproduction SLu, 22300 Barbastro, Spain. 3 Department of Animal Science, University of Lleida, 25198 Lleida, Spain. 4 Department of Veterinary Management of Animal Resources, University of Liège, 4000 Liège, Belgium.","Fernando López-Gatius , Irina Garcia-Ispierto , Christian Hanzen ",J Reprod Dev,2021 Dec 14,"Abortion, Induced*,Abortion, Spontaneous* / etiology,Abortion, Veterinary / etiology,Animals,Cattle,Cattle Diseases* / diagnosis,Cattle Diseases* / etiology,Female,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Multiple",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34615839
147,Non-invasive prenatal testing in the management of twin pregnancies,"Twin pregnancies are common and associated with pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes. Prenatal clinical management is intensive and has been hampered by inferior screening and less acceptable invasive testing. For aneuploidy screening, meta-analyses show that non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) through analysis of cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) is superior to serum and ultrasound-based tests. The positive predictive value for NIPT is driven strongly by the discriminatory power of the assay and only secondarily by the prior risk. Uncertainties in a priori risks for aneuploidies in twin pregnancies are therefore of lesser importance with NIPT. Additional information on zygosity can be obtained using NIPT. Establishing zygosity can be helpful when chorionicity was not reliably established early in pregnancy or where the there is a concern for one versus two affected fetuses. In dizygotic twin pregnancies, individual fetal fractions can be measured to ensure that both values are satisfactory. Vanishing twins can be identified by NIPT. Although clinical utility of routinely detecting vanishing twins has not yet been demonstrated, there are individual cases where cf-DNA analysis could be helpful in explaining unusual clinical or laboratory observations. We conclude that cf-DNA analysis and ultrasound have synergistic roles in the management of multiple gestational pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, UConn Health, Farmington, Connecticut, USA. 2 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA. 3 Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Englewood Hospital, Englewood, New Jersey, USA.","Peter Benn , Andrei Rebarber ",Prenat Diagn,2021 Sep,"Review,Adult,Aneuploidy,Female,Humans,Noninvasive Prenatal Testing / instrumentation,Noninvasive Prenatal Testing / methods*,Noninvasive Prenatal Testing / trends,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Maintenance / genetics,Pregnancy Maintenance / physiology,Pregnancy, Twin / blood*,Pregnancy, Twin / genetics",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34170028
148,Clinical analysis of 40 cases of external cephalic version without anesthesia,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the success rate, complications, and success-related factors of external cephalic version (ECV) of singleton breech pregnancies after 37 gestational weeks without anesthesia. Methods: We studied 40 singleton breech pregnancies in women who underwent ECV without anesthesia after 37 gestational weeks from October 2018 to March 2020. On the basis of success of ECV, the women were divided into two groups of the successful group and the failed group. Various factors were analyzed to determine those that affect the success of ECV. Results: Of the 40 attempts of ECV, 24 (60.0%) were successful and 16 (40.0%) failed. With regard to success-related factors, parity was significantly different between the two groups, with more multiparous women in the successful group than in the failed group. However, none of the other factors were significantly different between the groups. Fetal outcome was good in all of the cases. Ultimately, 3 cesarean sections were performed in the successful group and 16 were performed in the failed group. Conclusions: ECV of breech presentation after the 37th week of pregnancy without anesthesia is an effective and relatively safe alternative, and can effectively reduce the cesarean section rate.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wenzhou People's Hospital, Wenzhou, China. 2 Department of Chinese Medicine, Wenzhou People's Hospital, Wenzhou, China.","Zheng Zhi , Lin Xi ",J Int Med Res,2021 Jan,"Anesthesia*,Breech Presentation* / surgery,Cesarean Section,Female,Humans,Parity,Pregnancy,Version, Fetal*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33445992

150,Disease course and obstetric outcomes of pregnancies in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: are there any differences among disease subtypes? A single-centre retrospective study of prospectively followed pregnancies in a dedicated pregnancy clinic,"To study disease activity during pregnancy and obstetric outcomes in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) upon different subsets and with focus on medication use. Retrospective observational study of 22 pregnancies in 16 JIA patients (95.5% Caucasian) who were followed between 2010 and 2018. Disease activity, flares and medications were recorded before conception, during each trimester and postpartum period. Pregnancies occurred in 10 (45.5%) oligoarticular extended (OLA-E), 6 (27.3%) in polyarticular (PLA), 4 in (18.2%) systemic (SYS), 1 (4.5%) in oligoarticular persistent (OLA-P) and 1 (4.5%) in enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) JIA patients. The median age at disease diagnosis and at conception was 5.5 and 28 years (respectively). The median disease duration was 20 years. Nineteen (95%) pregnancies started in a period of stable disease remission. Among the 22 pregnancies, 20 ended with a live birth (90.9%). No spontaneous miscarriages occurred; two voluntary interruption of pregnancy were performed. There were 7 flares in 6/20 pregnancies (35%) and 8 flares (8/22, 36.4%) occurred in postpartum period, all of them in OLA-E and PLA patients. Seven patients (35%) were taking biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) at conception, and 6 of them stopped this treatment at positive pregnancy test. Five patients resumed bDMARDs either during pregnancy (3 exposed during the third trimester) or puerperium due to a flare. Four preterm deliveries (20%) were recorded, all in patients who had a flare during pregnancy. The preconception counselling should include the evaluation of disease subset, as OLA-E and PLA may flare more than other subsets, especially if bDMARDs are discontinued at positive pregnancy test. Continuation of bDMARDs during pregnancy should be considered to minimize the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly preterm delivery. Key Points • In our cohort, all the flares during pregnancy and 75% of postpartum flares were observed in patients who withdrew bDMARDs and cDMARDs at the beginning of pregnancy. • Flares were observed only in PLA and OLA-E patients. • Preterm delivery occurred in 20% of the pregnancies; all of these patients had a disease flare during pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Rheumatology Unit, Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Carretera de Colmenar Viejo, 9,1 km, 28034, Madrid, Spain. antiaaagf@gmail.com. 2 Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Unit, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy. 3 Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy. 4 Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy. 5 IM Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russia.","Antía García-Fernández , Maria Chiara Gerardi , Francesca Crisafulli , Matteo Filippini , Micaela Fredi , Roberto Gorla , Maria Grazia Lazzaroni , Andrea Lojacono , Cecilia Nalli , Francesca Ramazzotto , Marco Taglietti , Cristina Zanardini , Sonia Zatti , Franco Franceschini , Angela Tincani , Laura Andreoli ",Clin Rheumatol,2021 Jan,"Observational Study,Antirheumatic Agents* / therapeutic use,Arthritis, Juvenile* / drug therapy,Arthritis, Juvenile* / epidemiology,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Retrospective Studies,Antirheumatic Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32945981
151,The association of different parenting styles among depressed parents and their offspring's depression and anxiety: a cross-sectional study,"Background: Parenting styles play a critical role in children's development, especially for those in families with a depressed parent. To date, no study has explored whether youth perceptions of parenting style are heterogeneous in families with a depressed parent or whether heterogeneous parenting styles are associated with children's internalizing symptoms. Methods: Participants were children aged 8-16 years who had a parent with major depressive disorder; they were enrolled through their parents, who were outpatients at two hospitals in Ningxia. Parenting styles were measured using the Parental Bonding Instrument. Youth depression and anxiety were measured using the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children and the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders, respectively. We applied latent profile analysis to identify the subtypes of parenting styles with similar patterns. Differences between subtypes in relation to demographic variables and parenting style scores were calculated using one-way ANOVAs, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and chi-squared tests. Bivariate logistic analyses were conducted to examine the associations between parental bonding subtypes and children's depression and anxiety. Results: Four parenting styles were identified through latent profile analysis: care-autonomy, overprotection-indifference, indifference, and undifferentiated parenting. Youth with care-autonomy parents had a lower risk of depression (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.41) and anxiety (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10-0.48), while indifference parenting increased children's risk of depression (OR: 5.29; 95% CI: 1.30-21.54) more than undifferentiated parenting. Conclusions: Children with a depressed parent had heterogeneous perceptions of parenting styles. Mothers' and fathers' parenting styles were largely congruent. Care-autonomy parenting (high care and high autonomy) may decrease children's risk of depression, whereas indifference parenting (low care and autonomy) may increase their risk of depression.","Affiliations 1 School of Nursing and Rehabilitation, Shandong University, No. 44 Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong Province, China. 2 Ningxia Medical University, No. 1106 South Shengli Street, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China. 3 Mental Health Center, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, No. 804 South Shengli Street, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China. 4 School of Nursing and Rehabilitation, Shandong University, No. 44 Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong Province, China. caofenglin2008@126.com.","Yanrong Wang , Honglan Shi , Yuan Wang , Xuan Zhang , Juan Wang , Yaoyao Sun , Jianwen Wang , Jiwei Sun , Fenglin Cao ",BMC Psychiatry,2021 Oct 9,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Anxiety,Cross-Sectional Studies,Depression,Depressive Disorder, Major*,Female,Humans,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34627177

Design: Systematic review. Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Female and male individuals, either healthy or infertile. Intervention(s): Relevant articles were identified according to the The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses recommendations in the PubMed and EMBASE databases from January 1, 2000 to June 8, 2020. Main outcome measure(s): The association between sleep and ovary function, spermatic function, natural fertility, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes was assessed. Result(s): A total of 33 studies that looked at the association between sleep and either ovary function (n = 10), spermatic function (n = 12), natural fertility (n = 5), or IVF outcomes (n = 6) were included. Overall, female and male fertility, as well as IVF outcomes may be affected by short sleep duration, evening chronotype, or shift/night work schedules. However, the results were hardly comparable due to the heterogeneous study methodologies used. Conclusion(s): Sleep may be an original and innovative parameter to consider in the reproduction field. Further investigation is needed to elucidate how sleep and fertility are interrelated and how sleep might constitute a useful modifiable target in infertility management.","Affiliations 1 APHP, Hôtel-Dieu, Centre du sommeil et de la vigilance, centre de référence narcolepsies et hypersomnies rares, service de pathologies professionnelles et environnementales, Paris, France. 2 Service de Biologie de la Reproduction CECOS, Hôpital Tenon (AP-HP), Paris, France. 3 Service de Biologie de la Reproduction CECOS, Hôpital Tenon (AP-HP), Paris, France; Sorbonne Université, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine, Inserm US938, Paris, France. 4 APHP, Hôtel-Dieu, Centre du sommeil et de la vigilance, centre de référence narcolepsies et hypersomnies rares, service de pathologies professionnelles et environnementales, Paris, France; Université de Paris, 75181 VIFASOM (EA 7330 Vigilance, Fatigue Sommeil et Santé Publique), Paris, France. 5 Service de Biologie de la Reproduction CECOS, Hôpital Tenon (AP-HP), Paris, France; Sorbonne Université, Centre de recherche Saint-Antoine, Inserm US938, Paris, France.

153,Objective sleep duration and timing predicts completion of in vitro fertilization cycle,"Purpose: To examine associations between objectively measured sleep duration and sleep timing with odds of completion of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle. Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled 48 women undergoing IVF at a large tertiary medical center between 2015 and 2017. Sleep was assessed by wrist-worn actigraphy, 1-2 weeks prior to initiation of the IVF cycle. Reproductive and IVF cycle data and demographic and health information were obtained from medical charts. Sleep duration, midpoint, and bedtime were examined in relation to IVF cycle completion using logistic regression models, adjusted for age and anti-Müllerian hormone levels. A sub-analysis excluded women who worked non-day shifts to control for circadian misalignment. Results: The median age of all participants was 33 years, with 29% of women >35 years. Ten women had an IVF cycle cancelation prior to embryo transfer. These women had shorter sleep duration, more nocturnal awakenings, lower sleep efficiency, and later sleep timing relative to those who completed their cycle. Longer sleep duration was associated with lower odds of uncompleted IVF cycle (OR = 0.88; 95%CI 0.78, 1.00, per 20-min increment of increased sleep duration). Women with later sleep midpoint and later bedtime had higher odds of uncompleted cycle relative to those with earlier midpoint and earlier bedtime; OR = 1.24; 95%CI 1.09, 1.40 and OR = 1.33; 95%CI 1.17, 1.53 respectively, for 20-min increments. These results were independent of age, anti-Müllerian hormone levels, or sleep duration, and remained significant after exclusion of shift-working women. Conclusions: Shorter sleep duration and later sleep timing increase the odds of uncompleted cycles prior to embryo transfer.","Affiliations 1 Siriraj Sleep Center, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. 2 Department of Statistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 3 Division of Sleep Medicine, Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Med Inn C728, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-5845, USA. 4 Division of Fertility and Reproductive Health, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 5 Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Population Health Research, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD, USA. 6 Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 7 Division of Sleep Medicine, Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Med Inn C728, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-5845, USA. gldt@med.umich.edu.","Chawanont Pimolsri , Xiru Lyu , Cathy Goldstein , Chelsea N Fortin , Sunni L Mumford , Yolanda R Smith , Michael S Lanham , Louise M O'Brien , Galit Levi Dunietz ",J Assist Reprod Genet,2021 Oct,"Adult,Embryo Transfer / statistics & numerical data*,Female,Fertilization in Vitro / statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Pregnancy,Prospective Studies,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Quality*,Time Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34374922
154,Automatic sleep-stage scoring based on photoplethysmographic signals,"Objective: Sleep-stage scoring is important for sleep-quality evaluation and the diagnosis of related diseases. In this study, an automatic sleep-stage scoring method using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals was proposed. Approach: To construct the classification model, we extracted 14 time-domain features, 17 frequency-domain features, and 20 pulse rate variability (PRV) features along with four SpO2 features from PPG signals. An artificial neural network classifier was used to integrate the results of ten binary support vector machine classifiers and realise sleep-stage classification. Leave-one-subject-out validation was applied to evaluate our proposed model. Main results: Thirty-one subjects were enrolled in the study, in which 21 subjects were with high sleep quality (sleep efficiencies ⩾85%). Our model achieved accuracies of 57% (κ = 0.39), 62% (κ = 0.41), and 78% (κ = 0.54) for the classification of five sleep stages (wake, N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleeps), four sleep stages (wake, light, deep, and REM sleeps) and three sleep stages (wake, non-rapid eye movement (NREM), and REM sleeps), respectively. For the remaining ten subjects with poor sleep quality, the results came to 55% (κ = 0.39), 62% (κ = 0.43), and 75% (κ = 0.52). Significance: The satisfactory performance of our proposed model reveals the potential of PPG signals for sleep-stage scoring, which may contribute to automatic sleep monitoring in the home environment.","Affiliation 1 School of Biomedical Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275 People's Republic of China.","Xin Wu , Juan Yang, Yu Pan, Xiangmin Zhang, Yuxi Luo",Physiol Meas,2020 Jun 30,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Heart Rate,Humans,Neural Networks, Computer,Photoplethysmography*,Sleep Stages*,Sleep*,Support Vector Machine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32392540

157,False-positive cases in multiple sleep latency test by accumulated sleep debt,"Purpose: Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is performed as objective assessment of sleepiness, on the following day after polysomnography (PSG). In most clinics, patients are required to stay for 2 days. However, if patients have chronic sleep debt before the examination, even if they get adequate nocturnal sleep during the initial PSG, their sleep debt would not be fully resolved, affecting MSLT results. This may lead to improper administration of psycho-stimulant medication. To clarify the sleep debt for the patients who showed short sleep latencies, we compared the mean sleep latencies of MSLTs. Methods: Twelve hypersomnolent males, who underwent MSLTs (1st MSLT with 1 night and 2nd MSLT with more than 3 nights), were enrolled. We selected these cases based on the longer total sleep time on PSG night compared to the mean total sleep time on pre-examination sleep logs and shortened sleep latencies on PSG. To evaluate the effect of the sleep debt for the patients who showed short sleep latencies, we extended their hospitalization or re-hospitalized them. Results: The mean sleep latency of 1st MSLT was 5.8 minutes and that of 2nd was 13.9 minutes (P < .001). Among these 12 cases, 5 cases altered from short to normal sleep latencies at the 2nd MSLT. These 5 cases were prevented from over-diagnoses by the extension of evaluations. Conclusions: The sleep debt may produce false-positive results when patients are examined by standard PSG and MSLT. Accumulation of sleep debt will cause shortened sleep latencies in the following nights.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of sleep loss (sleep duration <6 h) on monitoring of performance and errors using Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO & Cochrane Central. We identified 28 studies, 11 of which were appropriate for meta-analysis. The systematic review indicated limited consensus regarding sleep loss impacts on performance monitoring, due to substantial differences in study methodology. However, participants typically demonstrated more conservative estimates of performance during sleep loss. Error-monitoring literature was more consistent, indicating an impairment in error-monitoring following sleep loss. Meta-analyses supported the findings of the systematic review. In terms of methodology, we found the performance monitoring literature is limited by an overreliance on correlational designs, which are likely confounded by response bias. The error-monitoring literature is limited by very few studies utilising behavioural measures to directly measure error-awareness. Future performance monitoring studies must employ methods which control for confounds such as bias, and error-monitoring studies must incorporate combined behavioural and ERP measures to better understand the impact of sleep loss on error-monitoring.","Affiliations 1 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Australia. 2 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Australia; Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Norway; Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway. 3 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Australia.

159,Cannabinoids and Sleep/Wake Control,"The sleep-wake cycle is a complex process that includes wake (W), non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Each phase is regulated by specialized brain structures that, by means of different neurotransmitters, maintain the constant expression of the sleep-wake cycle. Molecules like orexin, serotonin, noradrenaline, histamine, for waking; GABA, adenosine, prostaglandins, for NREM sleep and acetylcholine and glutamate for REM sleep, among other molecules are responsible for the expression and maintenance of each phase. When the endocannabinoid system was being described for the first time, almost three decades ago, oleamide's sleep promoting properties were highlighted. Nowadays, enough evidence has been cumulated to support the endocannabinoid system role in the sleep-wake cycle regulation. The endocannabinoids oleamide anandamide, and 2-arachidonylglycerol promote NREM and/or REM sleep via the CB1R, thereby making this system a target to treat sleep disorders, such as insomnia.","Affiliations 1 Laboratorio de Cannabinoides, Departamento de Fisiología, Facultad de Medicina, UNAM, Ciudad de México, Mexico. 2 Laboratorio de Neurogenómica Cognitiva, Coordinación de Psicobiología y Neurociencias.

160,Deconstructing Commercial Wearable Technology: Contributions toward Accurate and Free-Living Monitoring of Sleep,"Despite prolific demands and sales, commercial sleep assessment is primarily limited by the inability to ""measure"" sleep itself; rather, secondary physiological signals are captured, combined, and subsequently classified as sleep or a specific sleep state. Using markedly different approaches compared with gold-standard polysomnography, wearable companies purporting to measure sleep have rapidly developed during recent decades. These devices are advertised to monitor sleep via sensors such as accelerometers, electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, and temperature, alone or in combination, to estimate sleep stage based upon physiological patterns. However, without regulatory oversight, this market has historically manufactured products of poor accuracy, and rarely with third-party validation. Specifically, these devices vary in their capacities to capture a signal of interest, process the signal, perform physiological calculations, and ultimately classify a state (sleep vs. wake) or sleep stage during a given time domain. Device performance depends largely on success in all the aforementioned requirements. Thus, this review provides context surrounding the complex hardware and software developed by wearable device companies in their attempts to estimate sleep-related phenomena, and outlines considerations and contributing factors for overall device success.","Affiliation 1 Human Performance Innovation Center, Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA.","Lauren E Rentz , Hana K Ulman , Scott M Galster ",Sensors (Basel),2021 Jul 27,"Review,Photoplethysmography,Polysomnography,Sleep Stages,Sleep*,Wearable Electronic Devices*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34372308
161,Blood Coagulation Indices in Twin Pregnancy Complicated with Preeclampsia,"Objective: To determine the regular changes of blood coagulation indices in twin pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia (PE). Study design: Descriptive study. Place and duration of study: Fujian Provincial Maternity and Children Hospital from January 2014 to December 2017. Methodology: A total of 180 twin pregnancies were enrolled in this study, including 40 diagnosed as PE, 50 as severe PE (SPE), and 90 as normal twin pregnancies. The changes of coagulation parameters of twin pregnant women in different gestational states and periods were retrospectively analysed. Results: During the middle and late pregnancies in all groups, the PT (prothrombin time) decreased, and D-Di (D-dimers) increased gradually compared to early pregnancy (p <0.05). When D-Di increased abnormally, adverse pregnancy outcomes increased. APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) and TT (thromoplastin time) were shortened first and then significantly prolonged (p <0.05). In the normal twin group, FIB was increased gradually from early pregnancy to midlate pregnancy; in the PE group, FIB was increased and then decreased, especially in the sPE group (p <0.05). There was no significant difference in coagulation function in early pregnancy (p >0.05). FIB in sPE group was lower than that in other two groups in late pregnancy. TT in sPE group was higher than that in other two groups. D-Di and APTT in PE group and sPE group were higher than those in normal group (p <0.05). The TT sensitivity was 68.8% with specificity 72.4%, at cut-off value of 13.48 s (p <0.01). Conclusion: The regular changes of blood coagulation indices in twin pregnancy complicated with PE had great predictive and diagnostic value of preeclampsia.","Affiliation 1 Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Fujian Provincial Maternity and Children Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, P.R.

162,Parents' Perceptions and Experiences of Parenting Programmes: A Systematic Review and Metasynthesis of the Qualitative Literature,"Supporting parents to meet the challenges of their caregiving role is identified as a public health concern and a priority in policies internationally. Quantitative research has established the efficacy of parenting programmes but less is understood about the key aspects that make interventions meaningful and helpful to families. We aimed to explore parents' experiences and perceptions of parenting programmes in order to highlight the parent voice and identify key factors that parents perceive to be meaningful and improve our understanding of the acceptability and perceived benefits of parenting programmes. Six key electronic databases were searched systematically for qualitative research and eligibility for inclusion was established. A thematic synthesis was undertaken. Twenty-six studies were included, spanning 17 years of parenting research and involving 822 parents. Three main themes and nine subthemes were identified: (1) a family's journey (prior to the parenting programme, outcomes (including changes in the parent, child and wider family) and post-intervention), (2) aspects perceived to be important or valuable (group leader or facilitator, programme content and delivery and value of the group) and (3) challenges or difficulties (barriers to engagement or attendance, programme content and suggestions for improvement). Reported outcomes of parenting programmes included changes in the parent alongside changes in the child and family more widely. Key recommendations to improve provision of accessible, clinically and cost-effective interventions for parents include ensuring high-quality training and supervision of facilitators, balancing flexibility and fidelity to ensure tailored content to meet individual needs, a sensitivity to parental adversity, the need for wider familial support and the availability of ongoing support following the end of a parenting programme.","Affiliations 1 Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Zochonis Building, Brunswick Street, Manchester, M13 9PL, England, UK. 2 Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. 3 Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Zochonis Building, Brunswick Street, Manchester, M13 9PL, England, UK. anja.wittkowski@manchester.ac.uk. 4 Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. anja.wittkowski@manchester.ac.uk.","J Butler , L Gregg , R Calam , A Wittkowski ",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,2020 Jun,"Meta-Analysis,Systematic Review,Adult,Child,Education, Nonprofessional*,Humans,Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care*,Parenting*,Parents*,Program Evaluation*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31820298
163,Enhancing Current Cardiorespiratory-based Approaches of Sleep Stage Classification by Temporal Feature Stacking,"This paper presents a generic method to enhance performance and incorporate temporal information for cardiorespiratory-based sleep stage classification with a limited feature set and limited data. The classification algorithm relies on random forests and a feature set extracted from long-time home monitoring for sleep analysis. Employing temporal feature stacking, the system could be significantly improved in terms of Cohen's κ and accuracy. The detection performance could be improved for three classes of sleep stages (Wake, REM, Non-REM sleep), four classes (Wake, Non-REM-Light sleep, Non-REM Deep sleep, REM sleep), and five classes (Wake, N1, N2, N3/4, REM sleep) from a κ of 0.44 to 0.58, 0.33 to 0.51, and 0.28 to 0.44 respectively by stacking features before and after the epoch to be classified. Further analysis was done for the optimal length and combination method for this stacking approach. Overall, three methods and a variable duration between 30 s and 30 min have been analyzed.

164,Cannabis Use during Pregnancy and Risk of Adverse Birth Outcomes: A Longitudinal Cohort Study,"Background: With recent changes in legislation regulating recreational and medical cannabis use around the globe, increased use in pregnancy is to be expected. Objectives: To investigate the association between cannabis use during pregnancy and birth outcomes. Method: Data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), a prospective pregnancy cohort, were used. Participants were recruited from all over Norway between 1999 and 2008: 9,312 women with 10,373 pregnancies who reported use of cannabis before or in pregnancy. Women reported on their illegal drug use before pregnancy and at pregnancy weeks 17/18 and 30 and at 6 months postpartum. Linear regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on birth outcomes. Results: In 10,101 pregnancies, women had used cannabis before pregnancy but not during pregnancy. In 272 pregnancies, women had used cannabis during pregnancy, and among these, in 63 pregnancies, women had used cannabis in at least 2 periods. In adjusted analyses for potential confounders, only cannabis use during at least 2 periods of pregnancy showed statistically significant effects on birth weight. The effect was observed in the complete cohort (B = -228 g, 95% CI = -354 to -102, p < 0.001) and for the subgroup where information about the child's father was available (B = -225 g, 95% CI = -387 to -63, p = 0.01). Our results may indicate that prolonged use causes more harm, whereas short-term use did not indicate adverse effects on birth outcomes. Conclusions: There was a statistically significant and clinically relevant association between the use of cannabis during pregnancy and reduced birth weight. Clinicians should screen not only for cannabis use but also for the length and intensity of use as part of a comprehensive substance use screening.","Affiliations 1 Department of Addictology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czechia, roman.gabrhelik@lf1.cuni.cz. 2 Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway. 3 Department of Public Health and Nursing, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. 4 Norwegian Centre for Addiction Research, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.","Roman Gabrhelík , Milada Mahic , Ingunn Olea Lund , Jørgen Bramness , Randi Selmer , Eva Skovlund , Marte Handal , Svetlana Skurtveit ",Eur Addict Res,2021,"Cannabis / adverse effects*,Female,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Norway,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Prospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33040062
165,Longitudinal association between emotion-related parenting behavior and child aggression: The moderating role of parent-child physiological synchrony,"Considering the high prevalence of aggressive problems found in middle childhood and their negative impacts on children's overall adjustment, it is important to explore factors that may give rise to childhood aggression, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved within the family context. Applying a biopsychosocial approach, the aim of our study was to examine the relations between emotion-related parenting behavior (ERPB, e.g., parental psychological control and parental emotion dysregulation) and childhood aggression with a focus on the potential moderating effects of parent-child physiological synchrony on these relations. Eighty-nine parent-child dyads (total N = 178) participated in the study (child M age = 8.76 years, SD = 1.81 years, 49 boys). At T1, ERPB was observed and coded from dyadic interaction and parent-child physiological synchrony was assessed using interbeat interval (IBI) calculated from the participant's heart rate (HR) during an interaction task. Parents also reported their child's aggressive behavior at T1 and 9 months later (T2). The results showed that for children demonstrating stronger physiological synchrony with their parents, higher levels of parental psychological control and parental emotion dysregulation predicted their more aggressive behavior. Our findings suggest that for certain negative types of ERPB, parent-child physiological synchrony seems to be a risk factor for the development of children's aggressive behavior.","Affiliation 1 Beijing Key Laboratory of Applied Experimental Psychology, National Demonstration Center for Experimental Psychology Education, Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.","Nigela Ahemaitijiang , Haining Ren , Hui Wang , Zhuo Rachel Han ",Aggress Behav,2021 May,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aggression*,Child,Child Behavior,Emotions,Humans,Male,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33377187
166,Sleepy Surgeons: A Multi-Method Assessment of Sleep Deprivation and Performance in Surgery,"Background: Minimum rest is mandated in high stake industries such as aviation. The current system of healthcare provision permits on-call surgeons to work in sleep deprived states when performing procedures. Fatigue has been demonstrated to negatively affect performance. This study aimed to explore measurements of sleep deprivation and their impact on simulated performance. Methods: This was a single site study conducted between September 2019 and February 2020. Surgical trainee and consultants were conveniently sampled from a single site. All testing was done between 7 AM and 9 AM. Participants completed electroencephalogram testing using a modified Multiple Sleep Latency Test testing for objective sleep measurement, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale for subjective sleep measurement. The Psychomotor Vigilance Task and the SIMENDO simulated tasks were used for standardized performance assessment. Results: Surgeons entered sleep in 6 min, on average pre-call. This significantly decreased to an average of 164 s post-call (P = 0.016). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scoring was 5, indicating poor baseline sleep quality. There was higher self-reported fatigue and sleepiness in post-call states. Performance decrements were noted in cognitive performance reaction time and aspects of technical instrument proficiency. Conclusions: Surgeons are objectively sleep deprived pre-call according to internationally recognized guidelines. This sleep deprivation increases significantly in post-call states. Tasks with higher cognitive demands showed greater levels of diminished performance compared to those with lower cognitive demands. Current models of provision of surgical on-call are not conducive to optimizing sleep in surgeons. Prioritization of workload in post-call states, focusing on preserving individuals cognitive resources and utilizing lower cognitively demanding aspects of work is likely to have positive impacts on performance outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Department of Neurophysiology, Department of Surgery, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.

168,Sensory processing during sleep in Drosophila melanogaster,"During sleep, most animal species enter a state of reduced consciousness characterized by a marked sensory disconnect. Yet some processing of the external world must remain intact, given that a sleeping animal can be awoken by intense stimuli (for example, a loud noise or a bright light) or by soft but qualitatively salient stimuli (for example, the sound of a baby cooing or hearing one's own name1-3). How does a sleeping brain retain the ability to process the quality of sensory information? Here we present a paradigm to study the functional underpinnings of sensory discrimination during sleep in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that sleeping vinegar flies, like humans, discern the quality of sensory stimuli and are more likely to wake up in response to salient stimuli. We also show that the salience of a stimulus during sleep can be modulated by internal states. We offer a prototypical blueprint detailing a circuit involved in this process and its modulation as evidence that the system can be used to explore the cellular underpinnings of how a sleeping brain experiences the world.","Affiliations 1 Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK. 2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 3 Instituto de Fisiología, Biología Molecular y Neurociencias (IFIBYNE), UBA-CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 4 Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London, UK. giorgio@gilest.ro.","Alice S French , Quentin Geissmann , Esteban J Beckwith , Giorgio F Gilestro ",Nature,2021 Oct,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Drosophila melanogaster / genetics,Drosophila melanogaster / physiology*,Male,Neurons / physiology,Odorants / analysis,Olfactory Perception / genetics,Olfactory Perception / physiology,Perception / physiology*,Physical Stimulation,Sensation / genetics,Sensation / physiology*,Sleep / genetics,Sleep / physiology*,Smell / genetics,Smell / physiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34588694

I thus examine the causal effects of sleep on labor productivity, utilizing panel datasets for Japanese men. The potential endogeneity of deciding how many hours to sleep is addressed by using fixed effects panel data models with an instrumental variable estimation technique. Exploiting the annual variation in the average sunshine duration between cities as an instrument, I then show that a one-hour increase in the weekly number of hours of sleep increases the wage rate by up to 6-8% on average. These results suggest that sleep duration could enhance labor productivity.","Affiliation 1 Faculty of Economics, Kyoto Sangyo University, Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kita-ku, Kyoto 603-8555, Japan.

170,Unmet need for postpartum long-acting reversible contraception in women with substance use disorders and/or socioeconomic disadvantage,"Background: In Australia, it is estimated that 30% of pregnancies are unintended and 25% of pregnancies end in abortion. Unintended pregnancy can be particularly problematic for women with substance use disorders (SUD) and/or socioeconomic disadvantage. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) including progestogen implants and intrauterine devices (IUD) are safe, affordable and extremely effective in decreasing rates of unintended pregnancy, yet are currently underutilised in Australia. Aims: To determine the current rate of unintended pregnancy, contraception counselling and postpartum LARC use in women who attend an antenatal clinic for SUD and/or socioeconomic disadvantage in pregnancy. We hypothesise that there is an unmet need for contraception in this population. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective audit of women who birthed in a tertiary hospital in 2018 with SUD and/or additional social support needs. We recorded the rate of unintended pregnancy, the occurrence of antenatal and postpartum contraception counselling and the rate of immediate postpartum LARC uptake through review of our electronic medical database. Results: Of the 210 women in our study population, we identified a high proportion of unintended pregnancies (64%), a low rate of antenatal (11%) and postpartum (35%) contraception counselling, and a low uptake of immediate postpartum LARC use (3.3%), confirming an unmet need for contraception. Conclusions: Further intervention is required to enhance the access to immediate postpartum LARC and reduce the risk and health burden of unintended pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Maternity and Gynaecology, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. 2 Drug and Alcohol Clinical Services, Hunter New England Local Health District, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. 3 School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.","Emanuelle Best , Buddhima Lokuge , Adrian Dunlop , Angela Dunford ",Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol,2021 Apr,"Australia,Contraception,Female,Humans,Long-Acting Reversible Contraception*,Postpartum Period,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned,Retrospective Studies,Socioeconomic Factors,Substance-Related Disorders*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33619725
171,"Parenting in poor health: Examining associations between parental health, prescription drug use, and child maltreatment","Rationale: Child maltreatment and problematic parenting are related to negative outcomes for children. Poor parental health could be a risk factor for problematic parenting through several mechanisms: 1) inadequate emotional regulation and coping; 2) impairment of parental capacity; and, 3) impairment of the parent-child relationship. Objective: This study examines relationships between self-rated parental health, prescription drug use, and a broad array of negative parenting outcomes. Methods: A sample of general population parents of children aged ten and younger was recruited from 30 mid-sized cities in California (n = 681). Weighted mixed-effects negative binomial and logistic regression models were used to examine associations between poor parental health, prescription drug use and child maltreatment (physical abuse, supervisory neglect, and physical neglect), and problematic parenting (psychological aggression and corporal punishment). Results: Parents in poor health used physical abuse, corporal punishment, and psychological aggression more frequently and had higher odds of supervisory neglect. Parents who were taking more prescription medications had higher odds of physical neglect. Exploratory analyses suggested that prescriptions for certain medical conditions both increased and decreased the risk of problematic parenting. Conclusions: Poor health and prescription drug use are not uncommon and present largely under-recognized risk factors for a spectrum of adverse parenting outcomes. Our study provides additional evidence that parents in poor health are at heightened risk of negative parenting, and need targeted intervention supports to support family well-being.","Affiliations 1 School of Social Work, San Jose State University, One Washington Square, San Jose, CA, 95192, USA; Prevention Research Center, 2150 Shattuck Avenue, Suite 601, Berkeley, CA, 94704-1365, USA.

Methods: Retrospective cohort study of complicated MC twin pregnancies undergoing selective fetal reduction at a tertiary fetal center over a 20-year period. Obstetric and perinatal outcomes were compared. Results: 105 procedures met inclusion criteria: 74 RFAs, 17 lasers and 14 BCs. Procedure duration was significantly shorter for RFA (27.4 ± 15.8 minutes) compared to BC (91.7 ± 38.7 minutes) and laser (83.4 ± 40.4 minutes), P < .0001). The incidence of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and co-twin demise did not differ between groups, however preterm delivery <34 weeks occurred less frequently following RFA (29.7%), compared to laser (64.7%) or BC (42.9%) (P = .02); delivery <37 weeks was also less frequent following RFA (45.9%), compared to laser (76.5%) or BC (78.6%)(P = .01). The difference in preterm birth<34 weeks between RFA and laser was maintained after adjusting for cord occlusion indication and amnionicity (OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.27-12.31). Conclusions: In our experience, RFA procedures were simpler, faster and associated with a lower risk of preterm delivery <34 and <37 weeks, compared to laser or BC.","Affiliations 1 Ontario Fetal Centre, Fetal Medicine Unit, Dept.

The aim of this study was to explore profiles of parenting stress among 100 parents of young children with autism spectrum disorder enrolled in two clinical trials and to explore relationships between parenting stress level and parent ratings of child functioning before treatment. Secondary aims examined differential patterns of association between parenting stress profiles and parent versus clinician ratings of child functioning. We show that stress may influence parent ratings of certain child behaviors (e.g. problem behaviors) and not others (e.g. language), yet clinician ratings of these same children do not differ. This new understanding of parenting stress has implications for parent-rated measures, tracking treatment outcome, and the design of clinical trials.","Affiliations 1 Stanford University School of Medicine, USA. 2 Vanderbilt University Medical Center, USA.","Jessica M Schwartzman , Antonio Y Hardan , Grace W Gengoux ",Autism,2021 Aug,"Clinical Trial,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Autism Spectrum Disorder*,Child,Child Behavior,Child, Preschool,Humans,Parenting,Parents,Problem Behavior*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33691519

Methods: Literature search using the databases Web of Science, Ovid, Cochrane, Medline databases and an analysis of articles published in peer-reviewed journals with impact factor in the years 1958-2020. Results: Polyhydramnios occurs in 0.2-2% of pregnancies. Pregnancies with polyhydramnios are more often complicated by abnormal foetal lie or presentation and, moreover, should be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly with the higher incidence of intrauterine foetal death, placental abruption, labour induction, caesarean sections, prolonged first stage of labor and shoulder dystocia.

176,Reduction of multiple pregnancy: Counselling and techniques,"The incidence of multiple births has risen in the last few decades. This rise is mainly due to the widespread use of assisted reproduction techniques mainly as a result of increasing maternal age at conception. Twin and higher-order multiple pregnancies are associated with increased risk of perinatal, as well as maternal, mortality and morbidity compared to singleton pregnancies. There can also be psychosocial and socioeconomic implications for women and their families. In this chapter, we aim to discuss the risks associated with multiple pregnancies, the pros and cons of fetal reduction, the current techniques used in clinical practice, and how to approach counselling parents, enabling them to make informed decisions.","Affiliations 1 Fetal Medicine Unit, St George's University Hospitals, Blackshaw Road, London, UK. 2 Fetal Medicine Unit, St George's University Hospitals, Blackshaw Road, London, UK; Vascular Biology Research Centre, Molecular and Clinical Sciences Research Institute, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London, UK; Twins Trust Centre for Research and Clinical Excellence, UK.

177,Emerging biomarkers for child & family intervention studies: A review of EEG studies of parenting,"Most interventions for childhood mental health problems require significant parental involvement, and treatment programs are increasingly incorporating components aimed at enhancing parents' own self-regulation in the context of potentially stressful parent-child interactions. This paper discusses the promise of EEG in examining the rapidly unfolding perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and regulatory processes that occur in parenting, in hopes of ultimately informing child and family interventions. First, we review two separate bodies of work that have used EEG with parents: one examining event-related potential (ERP) measures, and the other examining frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). We discuss benefits of each within the study of parenting, and also suggest other EEG metrics (such as event-related time-frequency analyses) that can be leveraged to fill current gaps in our knowledge. Finally, we discuss the potential for these findings to inform clinical work with children and families, such as identifying biomarkers that could aid in assessment, treatment recommendations, and monitoring response to interventions.","Affiliations 1 Dept. of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences, Division of Population Behavioral Health, 760 Westwood Plaza, A8-153, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

178,[Physical activity and aromatherapy as positive factors influencing the quality of sleep],"Human sleep is a state of abolished consciousness controlled by circadian rhythms. It is divided into two phases depending on the electrical activity of the brain: NREM and REM, during which dreams may occur. Sleep has a key impact on a person's emotional, physical, and cognitive well-being. There are specific differences in physiological and biochemical processes during sleep. Adenosine and melatonin are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. During sleep, you can observe the secretion of growth hormone, a reduction in cortisol secretion, and a decrease in muscle tone and blood pressure. Longterm lack of sleep increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive disorders, and psychiatric diseases. Sleep disorders affect more and more social groups. The analysis of one's own circadian rhythms associated with the identification and adaptation of behaviors described as factors influencing sleep may have a positive impact on the optimal functioning of the body. It has been proven that physical activity and aromatherapy can have a positive effect on the quality of sleep. The aim of the study is to review of literature aimed at identifying selected factors influencing the quality of sleep together with a discussion of their importance for human health.","Affiliations 1 Wroclaw Medical University, Poland. 2 University of Vienna, Austria.","Aleksander Całkosiński , Izabela Chruścicka , Paulina Burzyńska , Klara Malinowski ",Pol Merkur Lekarski,2021 Dec 16,"Review,Aromatherapy*,Brain,Exercise,Humans,Sleep,Sleep Quality",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919095
179,Impaired wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep in dopamine-deficient mice,"Despite the established roles of the dopaminergic system in promoting arousal, the effects of loss of dopamine on the patterns of sleep and wakefulness remain elusive. Here, we examined the sleep architecture of dopamine-deficient (DD) mice, which were previously developed by global knockout of tyrosine hydroxylase and its specific rescue in noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons. We found that DD mice have reduced time spent in wakefulness. Unexpectedly, DD mice also exhibited a marked reduction in the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The electroencephalogram power spectrum of all vigilance states in DD mice were also affected. These results support the current understanding of the critical roles of the dopaminergic system in maintaining wakefulness and also implicate its previously unknown effects on REM sleep.","Affiliations 1 International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine (WPI-IIIS), University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305-8575, Japan. 2 Addictive Substance Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 156-8506, Japan. 3 Doctoral Programs in Neuroscience, Degree Programs in Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305-8575, Japan. 4 Department of Molecular Genetics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan. 5 International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine (WPI-IIIS), University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305-8575, Japan. hayashi.yu.4n@kyoto-u.ac.jp. 6 Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. hayashi.yu.4n@kyoto-u.ac.jp.","Mitsuaki Kashiwagi , Mika Kanuka , Kaeko Tanaka , Masayo Fujita , Ayaka Nakai , Chika Tatsuzawa , Kazuto Kobayashi , Kazutaka Ikeda , Yu Hayashi ",Mol Brain,2021 Nov 18,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Dopamine,Electroencephalography,Mice,Sleep / physiology,Sleep, REM* / physiology,Wakefulness* / physiology,Dopamine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34794460
180,Herbal Medicine for Behçet's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Patients with Behçet's disease often use complementary and alternative medicine for treating their symptoms, and herbal medicine is one of the options. This systematic review provides updated clinical evidence of the effectiveness of herbal medicine for the treatment of Behçet's disease (BD). We searched eleven electronic databases from inception to March 2020. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of BD treatment with herbal medicine decoctions were included. We used the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess the risk of bias and the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence (CoE). Albatross plot was also used to present the direction of effect observed. Eight studies were included. The risk of bias was unclear or low. The methodological quality was low or very low. Seven RCTs showed significant effects of herbal medicine on the total response rate (Risk ratio, RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45, seven studies, very low CoE). Four RCTs showed favorable effects of herbal medicine on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level compared with drug therapy. Herbal medicine favorably affected the ESR (MD -5.56, 95% CI -9.99 to -1.12, p = 0.01, I2 = 96%, five studies, very low CoE). However, herbal medicine did not have a superior effect on CRP. Two RCTs reported that herbal medicine significantly decreased the recurrence rate after three months of follow-up (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63, two studies, low CoE). Our findings suggest that herbal medicine is effective in treating BD. However, the included studies had a poor methodological quality and some limitations.

181,Conjoined twins in a spontaneous monochorionic triplet pregnancy: A case report and literature review,"Rationale: Conjoined twins are a rare complication of monochorionic pregnancies and an extremely rare condition in spontaneous triplet pregnancies. We report a case of conjoined twins in a spontaneous monochorionic triplet pregnancy. The conjoined twins might have suffered from twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, which was reported to be extremely rare. Patient concerns: A 26-year-old woman conceived spontaneously with an obstetric history of invasive mole 4 years ago. Diagnoses: We initially misdiagnosed her as having monochorionic triamniotic triplets at 10 weeks of gestation. However, we confirmed conjoint twins with the monochorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation and classified them as omphalopagus. Interventions: As the woman decided to continue the pregnancy, regular and careful antenatal care was conducted. Outcomes: Unexpectedly, she had a stillbirth 3 weeks later and had to terminate the pregnancy at 15 weeks of gestation. After abortion, the diagnosis of omphalopagus was confirmed in the induced fetuses. Moreover, the skin colors of the conjoined twins were different: one was plethoric, and the other was pale. Additionally, the parents agreed to examine the chromosome of the fetuses, and the results were normal. Conclusion: Dichorionic triplet and monochorionic triplet pregnancies have a poorer prognosis than trichorionic triplet pregnancies. Surgery is the main therapy for conjoined twins; however, most conjoined twins in triplet pregnancies cannot survive, including omphalopagus twins. The conjoined twins may have suffered from twin anemia-polycythemia sequence, which could probably not be diagnosed intrauterine. Transvaginal probe and 3-dimensional ultrasound may be helpful for clarifying the diagnosis in early pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Ultrasound, West China Second University Hospital. 2 Key Laboratory of Obstetric & Gynecological and Pediatric Diseases and Birth Defects of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.

182,"Whose parenting stress is more vulnerable to marital dissatisfaction? A within-couple approach examining gender, cognitive reappraisal, and parental identity","Conflict and tension in the couple relationship transfers to the parent-child relationship, amplifying the stress parents experience while parenting young children. Pinpointing moderating and individual-level factors that exist in this spillover process may identify both couple and individual areas where spillover might be mitigated. This study used a within-couple approach to test for gender differences in marital-to-parenting spillover and to examine the moderating roles of gender, parental identity, and the emotion regulation strategy cognitive reappraisal in the linkages between marital-parenting spillover. From a larger study of parenting experiences, 96 mother-father couples of young children (mean age = 3.22 years) reported on measures of marital satisfaction, cognitive reappraisal, parenting identity, and parenting stress. Using path model comparisons, we found more similarities than differences between mothers and fathers and, contrary to the hypothesis, that mothers experienced greater spillover between marital satisfaction and parental distress than fathers. Results differed between outcome measures, suggesting that parents experience more spillover from marital satisfaction to parenting in the context of parental distress than in dysfunctional interactions with their child. Importantly, we found that higher parental identity strengthened marital-to-parenting spillover for mothers in contrast to expectations based on theoretical assumptions, whereas cognitive reappraisal weakened marital-to-parenting spillover, supporting the broader emotion regulation literature. These results signify the importance of situating the marriage to parenting transfer in the context of affective experiences and intensified parenting expectations, wherein flexibility in role identity may help alleviate parenting stress.","Affiliation 1 Department of Child, Youth and Family Studies, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA.","Patty X Kuo , Victoria J Johnson ",Fam Process,2021 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child, Preschool,Cognition,Fathers,Female,Humans,Male,Marriage*,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33704779
183,Enhancing Caregiving in Traumatized Families: An Attachment-Centered Approach to Working with Parent Groups,"This paper outlines a model of attachment-centered group interventions to enhance caregiving among parents suffering from early trauma and/or social hardship. Groups are understood as an essential source of experiences that may restore traumatized adults' relational security, and enhance their parenting capacities, in face of biographical and contextual factors that compromise caregiving. The model is especially suited for intervention within social service/child protection contexts and with families that struggle to establish trusting alliances with professionals and institutions. Proposed intervention strategies are oriented toward making the group function as an attachment figure that meets parents' attachment and exploration needs and enhances parental sensitivity. Group therapists facilitate two sets of group processes: on the one hand, a sense of togetherness, emotional containment, protection and comfort (related to attachment needs); on the other hand, the development of parental mentalization, the revision of parental representations of the child, and the consolidation of parenting competence (related to exploration needs). A theoretical rationale for working with parent groups from an attachment-centered perspective, the basic intervention principles and specific strategies of the model are presented and illustrated.","Affiliation 1 University Institute of Family Studies, Pontifical Comillas University, Madrid, Spain.","Carlos Pitillas , Ana Berástegui ",Fam Process,2021 Dec,"Adult,Child,Humans,Object Attachment*,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33460106
184,Sleep's role in memory consolidation: What can we learn from atypical development?,"Research conducted over the last century has suggested a role for sleep in the processes guiding healthy cognition and development, including memory consolidation. Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) tend to have higher rates of sleep disturbances, which could relate to behavior issues, developmental delays, and learning difficulties. While several studies examine whether sleep exacerbates daytime difficulties and attention deficits in children with IDDs, this chapter focuses on the current state of knowledge regarding sleep and memory consolidation in typically developing (TD) groups and those at risk for learning difficulties. In particular, this chapter summarizes the current literature on sleep-dependent learning across developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome, Williams syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Learning Disabilities (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia). We also highlight the gaps in the current literature and identify challenges in studying sleep-dependent memory in children with different IDDs. This burgeoning new field highlights the importance of considering the role of sleep in memory retention across long delays when evaluating children's memory processes. Further, an understanding of typical and atypical development can mutually inform recent theories of sleep's role in memory.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, Unites States. 2 Department of Psychological Sciences, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States. 3 Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, Unites States; University of Arizona Sonoran UCEDD, Tucson, AZ, United States.

185,Sleep deprivation and memory: Meta-analytic reviews of studies on sleep deprivation before and after learning,"Research suggests that sleep deprivation both before and after encoding has a detrimental effect on memory for newly learned material. However, there is as yet no quantitative analyses of the size of these effects. We conducted two meta-analyses of studies published between 1970 and 2020 that investigated effects of total, acute sleep deprivation on memory (i.e., at least one full night of sleep deprivation): one for deprivation occurring before learning and one for deprivation occurring after learning. The impact of sleep deprivation after learning on memory was associated with Hedges' g = 0.277, 95% CI [0.177, 0.377]. Whether testing took place immediately after deprivation or after recovery sleep moderated the effect, with significantly larger effects observed in immediate tests. Procedural memory tasks also showed significantly larger effects than declarative memory tasks. The impact of sleep deprivation before learning was associated with Hedges' g = 0.621, 95% CI [0.473, 0.769]. Egger's tests for funnel plot asymmetry suggested significant publication bias in both meta-analyses. Statistical power was very low in most of the analyzed studies. Highly powered, preregistered replications are needed to estimate the underlying effect sizes more precisely.

186,Sex differences within sleep in gonadally intact rats,"Sleep impacts diverse physiological and neural processes and is itself affected by the menstrual cycle; however, few studies have examined the effects of the estrous cycle on sleep in rodents. Studies of disease mechanisms in females therefore lack critical information regarding estrous cycle influences on relevant sleep characteristics. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from multiple brain regions to assess sleep states as well as sleep traits such as spectral power and interregional spectral coherence in freely cycling females across the estrous cycle and compared with males. Our findings show that the high hormone phase of proestrus decreases the amount of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increases the amount of time spent awake compared with other estrous phases and to males. This spontaneous sleep deprivation of proestrus was followed by a sleep rebound in estrus which increased NREM and REM sleep. In proestrus, spectral power increased in the delta (0.5-4 Hz) and the gamma (30-60 Hz) ranges during NREM sleep, and increased in the theta range (5-9 Hz) during REM sleep during both proestrus and estrus. Slow-wave activity (SWA) and cortical sleep spindle density also increased in NREM sleep during proestrus. Finally, interregional NREM and REM spectral coherence increased during proestrus. This work demonstrates that the estrous cycle affects more facets of sleep than previously thought and reveals both sex differences in features of the sleep-wake cycle related to estrous phase that likely impact the myriad physiological processes influenced by sleep.","Affiliations 1 Molecular and Integrative Physiology Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 2 Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA. 3 Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Dept, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA. 4 Psychology Department, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA. 5 Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 6 Integrative Biology and Physiology Department, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA. 7 Psychiatry Department, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.","Kevin M Swift , Karina Keus , Christy Gonzalez Echeverria , Yesenia Cabrera , Janelly Jimenez , Jasmine Holloway , Brittany C Clawson , Gina R Poe ",Sleep,2020 May 12,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Electroencephalography,Female,Male,Rats,Sex Characteristics*,Sleep Deprivation,Sleep Stages,Sleep*,Sleep, REM",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31784755
187,A Model of Intention to Participate in Parenting Interventions: The Role of Parent Cognitions and Behaviors,"A wide range of factors, from perceived child behavior problems to sociocultural factors, have been identified as impacting the engagement of parents in parenting interventions. However, parents' cognitions and behaviors have not been evaluated sufficiently to understand their role in initial parental engagement. The current study aimed to examine why some parents are more likely to want to participate in parenting programs and how their cognitions and behaviors are related to their intention to participate in future parenting interventions. We tested the hypothesised model of parental factors on intention to participate using structural equation modelling (SEM) in AMOS. This study (N = 6,733) analyzed existing data from the International Parenting Survey (IPS), a web-based tool developed to collect information about parents' views on family and parenting at a population level in several countries. Results showed that parents' coercive parenting, parental consistency, positive encouragement, relationship with their child, parental self-efficacy, psychological distress, and help-seeking behaviors were significantly related to their intention to participate in future parenting interventions. The structural model of parents' cognitions and behaviors explained 16% of the variance in intention to participate. Although the current model explained a small but significant percentage of the variance, it expands existing understanding regarding parental cognitions and behaviors and their relationship to intention.

CARE was modified for delivery in the examination room, during routine primary care visits. Adopting a real-world implementation approach, clinical social workers were trained in the new model-IntegratedCARE-and provided the brief, 3-session treatment to 30 different parent-child dyads. Measurements included the Parental Stress Index-4 Short Form (PSI 4-SF), the Eyberg Childhood Behavior Inventory (ECBI), and the Therapy Attitude Inventory (TAI). There was a statistically significant mean score decrease on the both subscales of the ECBI at pre- and posttreatment. Scores on the TAI indicated that participants were satisfied with the treatment.

189,Fetal Hemodynamic Responses to Arterial Occlusion of Acardiac Twins,"The objective of this study was to comprehensively assess fetal hemodynamic adaptions to occlusive procedures. Twin pregnancies complicated with acardiac twin and hydrops fetalis of the pump twin were recruited. The occlusive procedures - either alcoholization, radiofrequency ablation, coil embolization or occlusive glue - were performed under ultrasound guidance. Various hemodynamic parameters were assessed before, shortly after, then every 6 h for 48 h and 2-4 weeks after the procedures. Seven pregnancies were recruited. The median (range) gestational age of intervention was 21 (17-26) weeks of gestation. Before the procedures, all cases showed normal cardiac function. Just after the procedures, all cases showed an increase in Tei index and isovolumic relaxation time but returned to preocclusion levels within 6-48 h, except for two cases that were persistently high. Increased preload and poor shortening fraction were observed in two cases, leading to heart failure, with one recovery and one death in utero. Five out of the seven cases got through the critical period with a gradual return to normal hemodynamics, ending with the disappearance of hydrops and successful outcomes. It was concluded that the occlusive procedure could aggravate the overworked heart, leading to heart failure. Preocclusion preload index and Tei index may predict risk of heart failure due to the occlusion. This small series strongly suggests that the occlusion should be performed before the deterioration of cardiac function.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.","Kuntharee Traisrisilp , Suchaya Luewan , Fuanglada Tongprasert , Kasemsri Srisupundit , Theera Tongsong ",Twin Res Hum Genet,2021 Aug,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Female,Heart Defects, Congenital*,Hemodynamics,Humans,Infant,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Twins,Twins, Conjoined*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34579794
190,Do all mammals dream?,"The presence of dreams in human sleep, especially in REM sleep, and the detection of physiologically similar states in mammals has led many to ponder whether animals experience similar sleep mentation. Recent advances in our understanding of the anatomical and physiological correlates of sleep stages, and thus dreaming, allow a better understanding of the possibility of dream mentation in nonhuman mammals. Here, we explore the potential for dream mentation, in both non-REM and REM sleep across mammals. If we take a hard-stance, that dream mentation only occurs during REM sleep, we conclude that it is unlikely that monotremes, cetaceans, and otariid seals while at sea, have the potential to experience dream mentation. Atypical REM sleep in other species, such as African elephants and Arabian oryx, may alter their potential to experience REM dream mentation. Alternatively, evidence that dream mentation occurs during both non-REM and REM sleep, indicates that all mammals have the potential to experience dream mentation. This non-REM dream mentation may be different in the species where non-REM is atypical, such as during unihemispheric sleep in aquatic mammals (cetaceans, sirens, and Otariid seals). In both scenarios, the cetaceans are the least likely mammalian group to experience vivid dream mentation due to the morphophysiological independence of their cerebral hemispheres. The application of techniques revealing dream mentation in humans to other mammals, specifically those that exhibit unusual sleep states, may lead to advances in our understanding of the neural underpinnings of dreams and conscious experiences.","Affiliations 1 School of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa. 2 Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, and Brain Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, California. 3 Brain Research Institute, Neurobiology Research, Sepulveda VA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.","Paul R Manger , Jerome M Siegel ",J Comp Neurol,2020 Dec 1,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Review,Animals,Dreams / physiology*,Dreams / psychology,Electroencephalography / methods*,Electroencephalography / psychology,Humans,Sleep Stages / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31960424
191,What single-unit recording studies tell us about the basic mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness,"This paper reviews the presence, localization and characteristics of state-specific neurons in the mouse forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain that are involved in the control of ultradian sleep-wake cycles and shows that all these regions contain basic neural elements capable of generating the sleep-wake cycle. The chronic single-unit recording method in unanaesthetized animals is useful for unravelling the dynamics of sleep-wake switching, in particular because it can analyse events at the level of single neurons, thereby decoding information used by the brain in determining its functional state. A prerequisite is to record a large number of all types of neurons, identify critical wake- and sleep-promoting neurons and determine their activity profiles during the sleep-wake cycle and their trends in spike activity during the state transitions from wakefulness to sleep and from sleep to wakefulness in the same species. Here, I argue that single-unit recordings in unanaesthetized mice help us to (a) determine key neural elements controlling sleep-wake dynamics, (b) elucidate the roles of forebrain and brainstem neurons in ultradian sleep-wake cyclicity and (c) gain a new insight into the functional significance of wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and paradoxical (or rapid eye movement) sleep. I also discuss the merits and limitations of single-unit recording compared with more recent genetic approaches, and I suggest that findings from studies using the classic electrophysiological technique will provide the foundation for future studies using new genetic techniques to dissect the neural networks responsible for the initiation, maintenance and cessation of each wake and sleep state.","Affiliation 1 Integrative Physiology of the Brain Arousal System, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, INSERM U1028, University Lyon 1, Lyon, France.",Kazuya Sakai ,Eur J Neurosci,2020 Sep,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Animals,Brain Stem,Mice,Sleep,Sleep, REM,Sleep, Slow-Wave*,Wakefulness*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31211887
192,A Randomized Clinical Trial Testing a Parenting Intervention Among Afghan and Rohingya Refugees in Malaysia,"Refugee families experience uncertainty and stress when residing in countries of first asylum, such as Malaysia, and may benefit from supportive parenting interventions. In the greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia area we piloted an eight-week parenting program with 79 Rohingya and Afghan mothers in nine separate groups. Participants were randomized to an intervention group or a waitlist control group and those in each arm completed a 3-month follow-up assessment. Program content addressed positive discipline, strengthening family relationships, adapting to a new environment, and improving health and emotional well-being. Measures assessed included child intensity and parenting self-efficacy from the Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale; positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, and poor supervision from the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire-Short Form; family intimacy and family conflict from the Family Functioning Scale, and emotional well-being from the Refugee Health Screening-15. Participating in the intervention led to beneficial changes in child intensity, parenting self-efficacy, family intimacy, family conflict, and emotional distress for the treatment group, and all changes except for emotional distress were maintained over time. However, the intervention did not lead to changes in positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, or poor supervision in the treatment group. Findings point to the potential benefits of parenting programs for refugee communities in transitory settings and contribute to the limited body of literature examining such programs.","Affiliations 1 School of Social Work, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA. 2 Department of Psychology, School of Social Work, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. 3 Dhi Consulting & Training, Penang, Malaysia. 4 School of Social Work, Brigham Young University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","Stacey A Shaw , Kaitlin P Ward , Veena Pillai , Latifa Mahram Ali , Hamid Karim ",Fam Process,2021 Sep,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Female,Humans,Malaysia,Mothers,Parenting*,Parents,Refugees*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32981083
193,The Use of Herbal Medicines for the Prevention of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis,"Glucocorticoids are drugs that are widely used to suppress inflammation and the activation of the immune system. However, the prolonged use or at high doses of glucocorticoid can result in adverse side effects including osteoporosis, bone loss, and an increased risk of fracture. A number of compounds derived from natural plant sources have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory activity by interacting with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), likely owing to their chemical similarity to glucocorticoids, or by regulating GR, without a concomitant risk of treatment-related side effects such as osteoporosis. Other herbal compounds can counteract the pathogenic processes underlying glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) by regulating homeostatic bone metabolic processes. Herein, we systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases to identify articles discussing such compounds published as of May 01, 2021. Compounds reported to exert anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid-like activity without inducing GIOP include escin, ginsenosides, and glycyrrhizic acid, while compounds reported to alleviate GIOP by improving osteoblast function or modulating steroid hormone synthesis include tanshinol and icariin.","Affiliation 1 Key Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology and Drug Evaluation, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, Yantai, China.","Leiming Zhang , Xiaoli Li , Tianhao Ying , Tian Wang , Fenghua Fu ",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),2021 Nov 12,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Animals,Bone Density / drug effects,Bone Density Conservation Agents,Female,Glucocorticoids / adverse effects*,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Male,Osteoporosis / chemically induced*,Osteoporosis / prevention & control*,Plant Preparations / therapeutic use*,Bone Density Conservation Agents,Glucocorticoids,Plant Preparations",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867788

Method: Following a comprehensive ADHD assessment, 58 Latinx families of school-aged children (mean age of 8 years) were randomly assigned to either culturally-adapted treatment (CAT) or standard evidence-based treatment (EBT). Parents completed an ADHD Knowledge measure both pre- and post-treatment. Results/conclusion: Latinx mothers demonstrated greater knowledge of ADHD symptomatology than fathers at pre-treatment. CAT resulted in improvements in parental knowledge of ADHD for both mothers and fathers, whereas standard EBT resulted in no change in maternal knowledge and reduced paternal knowledge of ADHD symptomatology. Clinical implications will be discussed.","Affiliations 1 Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI, USA. 2 Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.","Alyson C Gerdes , Anne Malkoff , Theresa L Kapke , Margaret Grace ",J Atten Disord,2021 Dec,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adolescent,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity* / therapy,Child,Fathers,Female,Humans,Male,Mothers,Parenting*,Parents,Sex Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32842839

Sleep problems are common among young children and is one of the most commonly expressed concerns reported by caregivers. Insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality, and irregular sleep schedules may affect children's physical health, cognitive capacity, socioemotional processes, and behavioral functioning, with implications for children's development and well-being. Family context and factors, confounded with cultural variables, play a critical role in children's sleep behavior and practices. This article presents research-based recommendations to enhance knowledge about children's sleep and to promote appropriate practices.","Affiliations 1 Center for the Study of Child Care Employment, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA. 2 Graduate School of Education, Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea.","Marisa Schlieber , Jisu Han ",J Genet Psychol,2021 Jul-Aug,"Review,Child,Child Development / physiology*,Family,Humans,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Hygiene",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33825621
196,Parenting by lying in childhood is associated with negative developmental outcomes in adulthood,"Parenting by lying refers to the parenting practice of deception to try to control children's behavioral and affective states. Although the practice is widely observed across cultures, few studies have examined its associations with psychological outcomes in adulthood. The current research fills this gap by sampling 379 young Singaporean adults who reported on their childhood exposure to parenting by lying, their current deceptive behaviors toward parents, and their psychosocial adjustment. Results revealed that the adults who remembered being exposed to higher levels of parenting by lying in childhood showed higher levels of deception toward their parents and higher levels of psychosocial maladjustment. Our findings suggest that parenting by lying may have negative implications for children's psychosocial functioning later in life.","Affiliations 1 Psychology Program, School of Social Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639818, Singapore.

197,Using realist approaches in nutrition and dietetics research,"Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the use and future potential of realist approaches to research in nutrition and dietetics. Methods: A targeted literature review was used to search key journals (n = 7) in nutrition and dietetics to identify existing research using a realist approach. A narrative synthesis was conducted to explore findings in relation to the research aim. Results: Nine research papers (four realist evaluations, five realist reviews) describing seven nutrition interventions were found, which revealed the application of realist research in nutrition and dietetics has focused on public health interventions. Realist research provided a deeper, more nuanced understanding of varied outcomes including the role of context, and contributed to the development of theory about how and why interventions work. As a theory-driven research method, realist research was able to assist in overcoming methodological shortcomings to contribute to meaningful, transferable findings. Conclusion: The results highlight the potential contribution of the realist research in nutrition and dietetics to evaluate interventions and inform future practice.","Affiliations 1 School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Western Australia, Australia. 2 Department of Nutrition, Dietetics and Food, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 3 Monash Centre for Scholarship in Health Education, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 4 Peninsula Medical School, Faculty of Health, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, England.","Gemma Jenkins , Isabella Maugeri , Claire Palermo , Rebecca Hardwick ",Nutr Diet,2021 Jul,"Review,Dietetics*,Humans,Nutritional Status,Public Health,Research Design",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34155774
198,Parenting with a spinal cord injury: A systematic review of mothers' and fathers' experiences,"Objective: A significant gap in the literature is the synthesis of qualitative studies exploring experiences of parenting with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Recent articles have tended to focus on disability more broadly, failing to account for the unique experience of the suddenness of SCI. Method: This article focuses on a qualitative systematic review of articles that addresses parents' experiences of parenting with an SCI. An analysis of seven articles and one book that met the inclusion criteria was conducted. Results: Three key themes were identified as pertinent factors that impact parents' experiences: parenting amplifying the disability, experiencing and challenging negative social attitudes, and continuities and change in the parenting role. Conclusions: These findings highlighted the constraints imposed upon people within both the public and private domains of their lives. Psychoeducation about SCI can facilitate greater inclusion and reduced stigma in society, while support in adjusting to their SCI would be helpful in fostering the parent-child relationship in the context of a life-changing injury.

199,Neuroplasticity: A Key Player in the Antidepressant Action of Chinese Herbal Medicine,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a systematic medicine. It provides alternative strategies for the treatment of depression with its clinical experience, comprehensive diagnosis, and treatment theory. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is the major form of TCM prescription, and numerous CHMs have been demonstrated to possess remarkable antidepressant-like properties. A diversity of mechanisms have been implicated in CHM-associated antidepressant property. This paper reviewed the neuroplastic mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of CHM, finding that CHM repairs neuroplasticity by improving neurogenesis, neurotrophic factors, synaptic spine morphology, cell signaling, glutamatergic system, monoamine neurotransmitters, and neural apoptosis. CHM thereby exerts an antidepressant effect, attempting to offer a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in TCM-related antidepressant-like efficacy and laying a foundation for the scientific evaluation and development of TCM in treating depression.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Rehabilitation Science, Nanjing Normal University of Special Education, Nanjing 210023, P.

200,Intergenerational co-parenting in the postpartum period: A concept analysis,"Background: With the increasing involvement of women in the workforce, the involvement of grandparents in infant care is a phenomenon that is climbing worldwide. Studies on intergenerational co-parenting are still in their infancy, and no consensus has been reached on the concept. Objectives: The aim here is to explore the antecedents, attributes, and consequences of intergenerational co-parenting and clarify the concept of intergenerational co-parenting specifically during the postpartum period. Methods: The Rodgers' evolutionary framework (2000) for concept analysis was adopted to guide the process of developing, clarifying, and refining the concept of ""intergenerational co-parenting."" Results: A total of 14 original articles on intergenerational co-parenting covering the postpartum period were included. Six attributes were identified from the literature: division of labor on infant care between parents and grandparents, generational boundaries, intergenerational transmission, reciprocal support between parents and grandparents in infant care, commitment on parenting decisions between parents and grandparents, and intergenerational communication. Sharing the responsibility of childrearing with grandparents, the development stage of the family, family structure, and cultural origins were antecedents of intergenerational co-parenting that emerged from the literature. The consequences of intergenerational co-parenting included the mother's parenting self-efficacy, the psychological health of both the grandparents and parents, the co-parenting relationship between the couple, and the intergenerational relationship. Conclusions: Based on the identified antecedents, attributes, and consequences of intergenerational co-parenting, and a definition of the concept of intergenerational co-parenting during the postpartum period of first-time parents, a conceptual framework was proposed. The conceptual framework will serve as a platform for developing a supportive program for intergenerational co-parenting in the postpartum period and for related research. To improve the intergenerational co-parenting relationship, postpartum interventions should involve both generations who are involved in infant care. In addition, the components of division of labor, generational boundaries, mutual support between the generations on infant care, the commitment on parenting decision-making within two generations, and skills of intergenerational communication should be considered in intergenerational co-parenting interventions.","Affiliations 1 Outpatient Department, Affiliated Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China; School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China. 2 School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.

203,Learning to let go: Parental over-engagement predicts poorer self-regulation in kindergartners,"Responsive parenting and parental scaffolding have been shown to foster executive functions (EFs) and self-regulation skills in young children, but could too much parental directive engagement be counterproductive? To answer this question, we examined parental responses when children were demonstrating active on-task behaviors in a community sample of 102 dyads. We measured the time that parents spend actively guiding children's behavior relative to following the child's lead and created a measure of parental over-engagement to index the degree of active parental engagement via positive control/scaffolding behaviors. We hypothesized that parental over-engagement would negatively relate to children's self-regulation and EF skills because it creates fewer opportunities for children to practice self-regulation by leading dyadic interaction with their parents. We used an innovative State-Space Grid method to capture second-to-second changes in parental and child behaviors during a set of structured tasks. We examined the conceptual overlap of over-engagement with the global ratings of parenting, revealing that parental over-engagement was negatively correlated with global ratings of parental scaffolding and unrelated to global ratings of parental sensitivity. Next, we showed that parental over-engagement predicted lower levels of child hot EFs and observed self-regulation, controlling for age, parent education, family income, and global ratings of parenting. The predictive validity of over-engagement was unique to times when the child was actively engaged and was absent when the child was passively engaged. This study contributes to the discussion of how parents can support the development of self-regulation during the transition to elementary school.

204,[The development of children nutrition science in Russia],"The article presents the main directions of children nutrition science in Russia, that starts at the Institute of Nutrition (nowadays Federal Research Centre of Nutrition, Biotechnology and Food Safety). Almost all areas of children nutrition - from early age to adulthood, from the organization of public nutrition to personalized approaches - were developed on the base of the Department of Children Nutrition, founded in 1932. Years of beneficial work of famous Russian specialists in the field of pediatric dietetics and nutrition science are associated with this Department, for instance professors E.M. Fateeva, K.S. Ladodo, I.Ya. Kon and their followers. The priority role of the Department of Children Nutrition in different areas of nutrition science is also shown in the article, for example in the development and improvement of physiological needs in nutrients and energy for children, pregnant and nursing women; development of new specialized infant foods, including first Russian formulas. Perinatal nutrition science, fundamental research on the composition of breast milk, creation of the system supporting breastfeeding, and design of dietary approaches to the correction of alimentary-dependent diseases were developed. The research on the effects of the hormonal composition of breast milk on the growth rate of infants who are breastfed has attracted the interest of the world scientific community. In recent years, fundamentally new scientific directions have been formed, based on the theory of ""food programming"", and nutrigenetic research has been developed. An important impetus in the development of modern pediatric nutritional science is the introduction of new approaches based on the achievements of nutritional metabolomics, nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics, digital technologies, and innovations in the field of food production. Nowadays children's nutrition in our country has confidently developed into an independent scientific direction, its main sections have been clearly identified: prenatal nutrition; infant and toddler nutrition; nutrition of preschool and school-age children; epidemiology of child nutrition; technologies for the production of infant and baby food and its safety.","Affiliation 1 Federal Research Centre of Nutrition, Biotechnology and Food Safety, 109240, Moscow, Russian Federation.","E A Pyrieva , M V Gmoshinskaya , A I Safronova , N M Shilina , N M Georgieva ",Vopr Pitan,2020,"Historical Article,Review,Adolescent,Adult,Breast Feeding*,Child,Child Nutrition Sciences / history*,Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena*,Child, Preschool,Female,Food Safety*,History, 20th Century,History, 21st Century,Humans,Infant,Infant Formula*,Infant, Newborn,Male,Milk, Human / chemistry,Milk, Human / metabolism*,Nutritional Status,Pregnancy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32986322
205,Therapist Factors Matter: A Systematic Review of Parent Interventions Directed at Children's Behavior Problems,"The present review systematically explored research examining the relationship between therapist-related factors and the outcomes of parent interventions directed at children's behavior problems. A systematic search of the literature was conducted with online scientific databases, parenting programs, web sites, and bibliographic references of the selected articles, according to PRISMA guidelines. A total of 24 quantitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Although some methodological limitations were identified with respect to the measurement of therapist factors, the reviewed research strongly suggests that the therapist plays a critical role in parent interventions directed at behavior problems. In particular, many parent outcomes are found to be related to the parent-therapist alliance, the therapist's fidelity to the intervention, specific therapist's in-session actions, and the therapist's personal variables. The parent-therapist alliance and therapist fidelity to the intervention consistently relate to changes in parenting practices, and alliance additionally relates to fewer perceived barriers to participation in treatment, more treatment acceptability, and greater parenting satisfaction and self-efficacy. In addition, specific in-session therapist interpersonal actions relate to parents' engagement and satisfaction, while both the therapist's interpersonal actions and more active skills relate to parent change. Therapist's personal variables have been scarcely or poorly studied to date, but the results found justify the need to develop further research in this area. In conclusion, more attention should be given to the role of the therapist when implementing parenting programs directed at behavior problems, and more and better research is needed that can overcome the methodological limitations identified.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. 2 Center for Research in Neuropsychology and Cognitive and Behavioral Intervention, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. 3 Centre for Social Studies, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.","Sara M Leitão , Maria João Seabra-Santos , Maria Filomena Gaspar ",Fam Process,2021 Mar,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Systematic Review,Child,Child Rearing,Humans,Parenting,Parents*,Problem Behavior*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32413195

The article begins by providing a definition of culture and how both parenting and culture can change over historical time. The article then presents some classic theoretical frameworks for understanding culture and parenting before considering why parenting may be similar across cultures and why parenting may be different across cultures. The article next turns to a review of cross-cultural similarities and differences in several aspects of parenting, including physical caregiving, cognitive stimulation, warmth and acceptance, control and monitoring, and discipline. Cultural normativeness and beliefs on the legitimacy of parental authority are then considered as potential moderators that contribute to cross-cultural similarities and differences in relations between parenting and child outcomes. The article then considers implications for parenting interventions and laws and policies related to parenting. Finally, the article suggests directions for future research.","Affiliation 1 Center for Child and Family Policy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.",Jennifer E Lansford ,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,2022 Apr,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Review,Child,Cross-Cultural Comparison,Humans,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting* / psychology,Parents / psychology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34763373
208,Delivering clinical evidence-based child-parent interventions for emotional development through a digital platform: A feasibility trial,"As the prevalence of mental health conditions in childhood increases, there are growing concerns around the accessibility and scale of evidence-based support. However, barriers to referral, time commitment and engagement rates means recommended traditional group-based parenting programmes are unable to provide population level support at scale. The aim of this feasibility study was to establish whether a suite of purposively constructed animated films and digital resources could positively impact on parent and child outcomes in the early years. Families from a range of backgrounds (n = 129) participated in a mixed method evaluation of the digital programme. After completing online surveys and interviews, the test group was given access to the Embers the Dragon platform for 8 weeks whilst the control group continued as usual. 98% of test group parents showed an improvement in parental response in relation to effective parenting styles. During qualitative interviews, child participants verbally recalled an increased range of emotions and coping strategies highlighted in the programme. Digital interventions can be used to support children's emotional development independent of clinicians and may provide a solution to sustainable family psychoeducation, thereby fulfilling a preventative agenda and potentially lessening the future impact on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.","Affiliations 1 Digital Mentality, London, UK. 2 School of Health and Social Care, 14283London Southbank University, London, UK. 3 School of Psychology, 5289Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK.","Emma Selby , Clare Allabyrne , Joseph R Keenan ",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,2021 Oct,"Adolescent,Emotions,Feasibility Studies,Humans,Mental Health,Parenting*,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34479455

211,Mothers' psychopathology symptoms and mindful parenting in the postpartum period: The role of parental reflective functioning,"Postpartum psychopathology has an adverse impact on parenting behaviors and, consequently, on the mother-infant relationship. This study aimed to explore whether the relationship between maternal anxiety and depression symptomatology in the postpartum period and the ability of mothers to adopt a mindful parenting approach is indirect and can be explained by parental reflective functioning. Two hundred ninety five Portuguese mothers of infants aged up to 12 months completed self-report measures assessing anxiety/depression symptoms, mindful parenting, and parental reflective functioning. Mothers who reported clinically significant anxious and/or depressive symptomatology levels (21%) showed lower levels of mindful parenting and of certainty about the mental states as well as higher levels of prementalizing modes of mental states than mothers with normal symptomatology levels. An indirect effect of depressive symptomatology on mindful parenting through the two dimensions of parental reflective functioning and a direct effect of anxious symptomatology on mindful parenting were found. The results suggest that parental reflective functioning is an important explanatory mechanism of the relationship between depressive symptomatology and mindful parenting, as well as that anxious symptomatology is directly associated with mindful parenting. This study suggests that reducing anxious and depressive symptoms in the postpartum period can promote reflective and mindful parenting skills.","Affiliation 1 Center for Research in Neuropsychology and Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Coimbra, Rua do Colégio Novo, Coimbra, Portugal.","Cristiana Nobre-Trindade , Maria Inês Caçador , Maria Cristina Canavarro , Helena Moreira ",Infant Ment Health J,2021 Nov,"Depression, Postpartum*,Female,Humans,Infant,Mother-Child Relations,Mothers*,Parenting,Parents,Postpartum Period",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34741468
212,"A Systematic Review Focusing on Psychotherapeutic Interventions that Impact Parental Psychopathology, Child Psychopathology and Parenting Behavior","Given the high rates of co-occurrence of psychopathology within families, it is important to identify and characterize interventions that simultaneously reduce both parent and child symptoms, and improve parenting quality. This is needed as intervention development is increasingly moving toward integrated interventions that target some combination of parent and child mental health, and parenting behavior. Even so, much remains unknown regarding which treatment components provide maximum benefit for parent symptoms, child symptoms, and parenting behavior. This systematic review identified and characterized psychotherapeutic interventions that report improvements in each of three outcomes: parent symptoms, child symptoms and parenting behavior. Fifty-six unique interventions were eligible for review, of which 25 reported improvements in all three outcomes. All 25 of these interventions directly intervened on parenting behavior, often as the sole target of the intervention. Few interventions improved all three outcomes in samples in which parents, children or both met clinical-level thresholds of psychopathology. Additional research is needed to better understand the bi-directional and transactional influences of treatment on family members, and to better inform the development of interventions for dually disordered parent-child dyads across a range of diagnostic profiles.","Affiliations 1 University of Oregon, 1227 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403, USA. yeverett@uoregon.edu. 2 University of Oregon, 1227 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, 97403, USA.","Yoel Everett , Christina Gamache Martin , Maureen Zalewski ",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,2021 Sep,"Review,Systematic Review,Child,Child Behavior,Humans,Mental Disorders* / therapy,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34254219
213,Parental feeding practices and children's disordered eating among single parents and co-parents,"Objective: Some parental feeding practices are associated with pediatric disordered eating and weight status. Existing research, however, has focused on maternal feeding practices in co-parent households. Single parents and fathers are notably understudied in this area. The current study examined associations of parental feeding practices with child disordered eating behaviors and weight, and compared associations between single mothers and fathers with a matched sample of co-parenting mothers and fathers. Method: Parents (N = 524) of youth between 5 and 16 years completed an online survey that included measures of parental feeding practices and unhealthy eating/weight-related parenting practices. Co-parents were matched to each single parent based on gender, race, ethnicity, education level, age, and BMI. Results: Single parents reported significantly greater concern about their child's weight, eating and shape, and reported engaging in more restraint and restriction of their child's eating, as well as having more perceived responsibility of their child's eating than caregivers in co-parent households. Children of single parents were significantly more likely to engage in secretive eating. Discussion: Associations between single parents' feeding practices and child weight and disordered eating parallel the broader literature. There were differences between single mothers and fathers and co-parenting mothers and fathers, particularly in their report of their unhealthy eating/weight-related parenting practices. Such differences may influence children's longer-term eating behaviors and weight status. Further research on single-parent households is needed, including longitudinal and epidemiological studies.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.","Rebecca C Kamody , Janet A Lydecker ",Int J Eat Disord,2021 May,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adolescent,Body Weight,Child,Child Behavior,Feeding Behavior,Feeding and Eating Disorders*,Female,Humans,Mothers,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting,Single Parent*,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33624860

215,Maternal experiences of domestic abuse and their effect on the mother's approach to parenting,"Children's nurses have an important role in identifying and supporting families who experience domestic abuse. Safeguarding guidance is available to direct nurses working with families, children and young people in these situations. However, nurses working with children and families require the knowledge and ability to assess the parenting approach of mothers exposed to domestic abuse to reduce long-term detrimental effects to the child. The aim of this literature review was to explore research about how maternal experiences of domestic abuse affect the mother's approach to parenting. A search of healthcare databases was undertaken to identify relevant research. The articles were coded by grouping similar findings leading to the identification of three themes: modelling behaviours; compensating behaviours; and coping and parenting. Modelling behaviours involved mothers learning aggressive behaviours and becoming increasingly violent towards their child. Mothers displaying compensating behaviours were lenient in their parenting or provided positive discipline if the child was female, and those who were identified as coping and parenting had suboptimal mental health with an increase in depressive symptoms.","Affiliation 1 Children's Nursing, University of Hull, Hull, England.",Louise Morgan ,Nurs Child Young People,2020 Sep 10,"Domestic Violence / psychology*,Humans,Mothers / psychology*,Nurse's Role / psychology,Parenting / psychology*,Parenting / trends",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32672027
216,Group-based parent support during the transition to parenthood: Primary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial,"Rationale: Theory suggests that when parents believe in their ability to positively influence their children, the children are at lower risk of poor developmental outcome. For this reason, parents' sense of competence is a common target in early parenting interventions. Objective: This study assessed effects on parents' sense of competence, parenting stress, and symptoms of depression from a widely implemented universal and group-based parenting program. Methods: In total, 1701 families were enrolled and randomised to one of two conditions a) participation in Family Start up Program (FSP), currently implemented at large scale in Denmark, or b) Care as Usual (CAU). FSP aims to empower new parents through knowledge and network. CAU is the public pre- and post-natal care available to families in both conditions. Recruitment was conducted between November 24, 2014, and February 1, 2017 at Aarhus University Hospital, from all incoming pregnant women within one of the larger Danish municipalities. In total, 4313 families were assessed for eligibility. Data were analysed as intention-to-treat and with n = 1255 (74%) mothers and n = 984 (60%) partners who responded at 10 months postpartum. Results: When randomised to the FSP, 92% of the mothers and 94% of the partners received the intervention attending an average of 8.4 [SD = 3∙4] and 7.9 [SD = 3∙3] group meetings, respectively. The program evaluation data indicated that parents were satisfied with the program. We found no mean differences between FSP and CAU in parental sense of competence, parental stress, or symptoms of depression at 10 months in mothers or partners. Conclusion: The intervention did not influence parents' sense of competence even if the parents attended and liked the group meetings. This highlights the need for refinement of either the intervention approach or the expectation to its outcome.

217,Negative Controlling Parenting and Child Personality as Modifiers of Psychosocial Development in Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A 9-Year Longitudinal Study at the Level of Within-Person Change,"This nine-year longitudinal study addresses the joint contribution of parent-rated negative controlling parenting and child personality on psychosocial outcomes in 141 families of children with autism spectrum disorder (83% boys, mean age Time 1 = 10.1). Latent change modeling revealed substantial variation in within-person change in parenting and psychosocial outcomes across a six- and three-year-interval. Over time, negative controlling parenting and child personality were consistently related to externalizing problems, whereas child personality was differentially related to internalizing problems and psychosocial strengths. Three personality-by-parenting interactions were significant, suggesting that children with less mature personality traits show more externalizing behaviors in the presence of controlling parenting. This study identified both parenting and child personality as important modifiers of developmental outcomes in youth with autism.","Affiliations 1 Department of Special Needs Education, Ghent University, Henri Dunantlaan 1, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.

218,The role of parenting behaviors in the bidirectional and intergenerational transmission of depression and anxiety between parents and early adolescent youth,"Background: Parenting is a modifiable factor proposed to underpin the transmission of anxiety and depression from parents to children. This study examined the role of parenting in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depression across pre- and early adolescence. Method: Participants were 531 youth (Mage = 11.18, SD = 0.56; 50.85% boys) and their parent. Child and parent anxiety and depression, and parental rejection, warmth and overprotection were assessed annually over 3 years. Bidirectional relationships between parent and child anxiety and depression, and the mediating role of parenting behaviors, were examined using cross-lagged panel models. Results: Results suggest bidirectional associations over time between parent and child depression, and parental rejection and child depression. Parental rejection and low warmth were associated with increases in child depression, but did not mediate depression transmission. Parental anxiety was associated with increases in child anxiety and depression, but there was no bidirectional association from child psychopathology to parental anxiety. There was little evidence that parenting predicted changes in child anxiety over time. Child anxiety and depression were associated with subsequent increases in parental depression. Conclusion: Parental depression, rejection and low warmth are independent risk factors for child depression. Parental rejection may also be a consequence of parenting a depressed youth. Parenting did not account for the apparent transmission of parental anxiety to increased child anxiety and depression. Child psychopathology increases risk of parental depression. Parental rejection may be an important modifiable risk factor for youth depression in early adolescence, and may also reduce later risk of parent depression.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, Centre for Emotional Health, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. 2 School of Psychological Science, Centre for Sleep Science, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.","Carly J Johnco , Natasha R Magson , Jasmine Fardouly , Ella L Oar , Miriam K Forbes , Cele Richardson , Ronald M Rapee ",Depress Anxiety,2021 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Anxiety* / epidemiology,Child,Depression* / epidemiology,Female,Humans,Male,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting* / psychology,Parents / psychology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34255922

220,"Mitochondrial Function as a Potential Tool for Assessing Function, Quality and Adulteration in Medicinal Herbal Teas","Quality control has been a significant issue in herbal medicine since herbs became widely used to heal. Modern technologies have improved the methods of evaluating the quality of medicinal herbs but the methods of adulterating them have also grown in sophistication. In this paper we undertook a comprehensive literature search to identify the key analytical techniques used in the quality control of herbal medicine, reviewing their uses and limitations. We also present a new tool, based on mitochondrial profiling, that can be used to measure medicinal herbal quality. Besides being fundamental to the energy metabolism required for most cellular activities, mitochondria play a direct role in cellular signalling, apoptosis, stress responses, inflammation, cancer, ageing, and neurological function, mirroring some of the most common reasons people take herbal medicines. A fingerprint of the specific mitochondrial effects of medicinal herbs can be documented in order to assess their potential efficacy, detect adulterations that modulate these effects and determine the relative potency of batches. Furthermore, through this method it will be possible to assess whole herbs or complex formulas thus avoiding the issues inherent in identifying active ingredients which may be complex or unknown. Thus, while current analytical methods focus on determining the chemical quality of herbal medicines, including adulteration and contamination, mitochondrial functional analysis offers a new way of determining the quality of plant derived products that is more closely linked to the biological activity of a product and its potential clinical effectiveness.","Affiliations 1 Research Centre for Optimal Health, School of Life Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom. 2 Health Innovation Ecosystem, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom. 3 Research Group 'Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy', UCL School of Pharmacy, London, United Kingdom.","Steven B Woodley , Rhys R Mould , Meliz Sahuri-Arisoylu , Ifigeneia Kalampouka , Anthony Booker , Jimmy D Bell ",Front Pharmacol,2021 Apr 26,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33981240

222,"""Sometimes I think my frustration is the real issue"": A qualitative study of parents' experiences of transformation after a parenting programme","Introduction: Parenting programmes help to alleviate conduct problems in children, but ensuring that all parents feel supported to attend, complete and learn from these programmes has proven difficult. Parents can feel overwhelmed and struggle to change their parenting. This article aims to inform the future refinement of parenting programmes by examining parents' narratives of how programmes motivated them to change and enabled them to put changes into practice. Method and results: Forty-two parents, most of whom had attended Incredible Years group sessions, were interviewed about their views and experiences of parenting programmes that focused on positive parenting practices. Analysis of interview transcripts drew on thematic approaches. Parents perceived that parenting programmes helped them to better understand their child and themselves and to let go of anxieties surrounding their child's behaviour. Better understanding included greater awareness of emotions and of behaviours their child could and could not control. Parents believed this awareness helped them to change the ways that they interacted with their child, which, in turn, helped them and their child to feel calmer. With greater understanding and calmness parents believed they became more able to see for themselves the changes that they could make in their parenting and everyday lives, and to feel more confident in putting these into practice. Discussion: By supporting parents to reflect on their own and their child's situation, parents perceived that programmes enabled them to improve interactions with their children without getting stuck in self-blame or feeling overwhelmed. Parents of children whose behaviour remained challenging believed that programmes led to beneficial changes in the way they felt about their child's behaviours. Enhanced support for reflection by parents could potentially help more families to benefit from parenting programmes.","Affiliations 1 Public Health, Policy and Systems, Institute of Population Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. 2 Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.","Kathy McKay , Eilis Kennedy , Bridget Young ",PLoS One,2021 Oct 12,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Education, Nonprofessional*,Female,Humans,Male,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Problem Behavior,Qualitative Research,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34637452
223,Apoptosis Exerts a Vital Role in the Treatment of Colitis-Associated Cancer by Herbal Medicine,"Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-developed colorectal cancer, the pathogenesis of which involves the occurrence of apoptosis. Western drugs clinically applied to CAC are often single-targeted and exert many adverse reactions after long-term administration, so it is urgent to develop new drugs for the treatment of CAC. Herbal medicines commonly have multiple components with multiple targets, and most of them are low-toxicity. Some herbal medicines have been reported to ameliorate CAC through inducing apoptosis, but there is still a lack of systematic review. In this work, we reviewed articles published in Sci Finder, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, and other databases in recent years by setting the keywords as apoptosis in combination with colitis-associated cancer. We summarized the herbal medicine extracts or their compounds that can prevent CAC by modulating apoptosis and analyzed the mechanism of action. The results show the following. (1) Herbal medicines regulate both the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and death receptor apoptosis pathway. (2) Herbal medicines modulate the above two apoptotic pathways by affecting signal transductions of IL-6/STAT3, MAPK/NF-κ B, Oxidative stress, Non-canonical TGF-β1, WNT/β-catenin, and Cell cycle, thereby ameliorating CAC. We conclude that following. (1) Studies on the role of herbal medicine in regulating apoptosis through the Ras/Raf/ERK, WNT/β-catenin, and Cell cycle pathways have not yet been carried out in sufficient depth. (2) The active constituents of reported anti-CAC herbal medicine mainly include polyphenols, terpenoids, and saccharide. Also, we identified other herbal medicines with the constituents mentioned above as their main components, aiming to provide a reference for the clinical use of herbal medicine in the treatment of CAC. (3) New dosage forms can be utilized to elevate the targeting and reduce the toxicity of herbal medicine.","Affiliations 1 College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China. 2 Department of Pharmacology, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, China. 3 Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China. 4 Innovative Institute of Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.","Ruimin Tian , Xianfeng Liu , Yanqin Luo , Shengnan Jiang , Hong Liu , Fengming You , Chuan Zheng , Jiasi Wu ",Front Pharmacol,2020 Apr 28,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32410986
224,Subjective experiences of participating in an attachment-based early intervention parenting program,"This qualitative study evaluated an attachment-based group parenting program that utilises mentalisation-based approach. The Building Early Attachment and Resilience (BEAR) program was designed to promote parent-child attachment across the perinatal period and has pre- and post-natal arms. The post-natal component targets mothers and infants at risk for early disturbances of attachment to, and emotional interaction. This evaluation study aimed to explore mothers' subjective experiences of the post-natal BEAR program in encouraging mothers' reflection on their role as a parent. Thirteen mothers were interviewed. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis, with five themes emerging. Overall, mothers reported that the intervention promoted reflection about the parenting role, contributed to perceptions of improved mother-infant interactions and increased understanding of their infant's internal experiences. The results suggest the BEAR program is acceptable and facilitates the development of secure parent-infant attachment.","Affiliations 1 Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia. 2 Centre for Women's Mental Health, The Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. 3 Department of Psychiatry, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.","Sophie Li-Shan Tan , Lesley Stafford , Christina Bryant , Hannah Jensen , Angela Komiti , Louise Newman ",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,2021 Oct,"Female,Humans,Infant,Mother-Child Relations,Mothers,Object Attachment*,Parenting*,Parents,Pregnancy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33878940

227,A Novel Biocompatible Herbal Extract-Loaded Hydrogel for Acne Treatment and Repair,"A novel herbal extract-loaded gel containing several biofunctional extracts, including green tea, Zingiber officinale Rosc, Phyllanthus emblica, and salicylic acid, was developed for acne vulgaris. These natural raw materials were blended with suitable dosages of gelatin and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) to produce a biocompatible herbal gel. The physical chemistry properties of the hydrogel were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), rheometry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the hydrogel showed good mechanical and morphological characteristics. The herbal extract-loaded hydrogel mimicked extracellular matrix properties and showed good antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and various advantages, serving as a potential wound dressing material because of its high moisture retention ability, wound exudate absorption behavior, and biocompatibility. It exhibited moderate-high antioxidative and anti-inflammatory qualities that were important for dermis wound closure. The clinical trial results showed that most patients experienced moderate to high healing rates, and four of twenty-four individuals (16.67%) had recovery area ratios greater than 80%. This herbal extract-loaded hydrogel has effective ingredients and excellent mechanical properties as a bioactive dressing agent for acne treatment.","Affiliations 1 Graduate Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung City 402, Taiwan. 2 Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Armed Forces General Hospital, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. 3 Deloitte Institute of Biology, Yangtze River Delta Research Institute, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 4 Department of Seafood Science, National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. 5 Department of Plant Pathology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung City 402, Taiwan. 6 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 704, Taiwan. 7 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan. 8 Ph.D. Program in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung City 402, Taiwan. 9 Department of Bio-Industrial Mechatronics Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung City 402, Taiwan. 10 Innovation and Development Center of Sustainable Agriculture, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung City 402, Taiwan. 11 School of Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362021, China. 12 Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. 13 Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, China Medical University, Taichung City, Taiwan.","Ying-Yi Lin , Shu-Hsu Lu , Rong Gao , Chia-Hung Kuo , Wen-Hisn Chung , Wei-Chih Lien , Ching-Chou Wu , Yong Diao , Hui-Min David Wang ",Oxid Med Cell Longev,2021 Nov 2,"Acne Vulgaris / drug therapy*,Bandages*,Biocompatible Materials / pharmacology*,Herbal Medicine*,Humans,Hydrogels / administration & dosage*,Hydrogels / chemistry,Plant Extracts / pharmacology*,Wound Healing*,Biocompatible Materials,Hydrogels,Plant Extracts",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34765083

As per the WHO, statistical incidence of CAD has increased in several countries. The number of coronary events worldwide has been increasing, and may increase even more in the near future. Meanwhile, increased sedentary behavior and poor diet will encourage the prevalence of CAD worldwide. As far as treatment is concerned, current conventional therapies have limitations due to their increased adverse events. The current approach to the management of CAD has certain lacunas that need to be overcome. Thus, new therapeutic options should be explored using traditional literature and current scientific data on natural products.

229,"Parental Attributions in Ethnocultural Minority, Immigrant, and Country of Origin Parents: A Scoping Review and Call for Research","Objective: Maladaptive parental attributions for their children's behavior have been linked to poorer parenting skills, heightened child internalizing and externalizing difficulties, and parents' less willingness to engage in treatment. Although most parental attributions research has been focused on White or European-origin parents, attention has recently turned to ethnic and cultural groups that are underrepresented literature. The present scoping review synthesized existing work on parental attributions among ethnocultural minority and immigrant parents in an adopted country and parents residing in their native non-Western country of origin. Method: A systematic search of five databases was conducted for literature published up to and including the last week of December 2020. Title and abstract screening, then full-text screening, identified 18 records for inclusion in the review. Results: Although descriptive, single-culture studies showed that maladaptive parental attributions were associated with poorer parenting and child outcomes across cultures, studies comparing ethnocultural groups demonstrated differences in parental attributions across groups. Conclusions: Despite the rise in and importance of literature on parental attributions, these results point to a limited scope in understanding parental attributions of ethnocultural minority, immigrant, and country of origin parents. Gaps identified in the literature point to promising future research directions, and a call is made for culturally sensitive parental attribution measures.","Affiliations 1 McCain Centre for Child, Youth and Family Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada. hali.kil@umontreal.ca. 2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. hali.kil@umontreal.ca. 3 Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada. hali.kil@umontreal.ca. 4 McCain Centre for Child, Youth and Family Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada. 5 Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. 6 University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. 7 CAMH Library & Archives, CAMH Education, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada. 8 Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.","Hali Kil , Anneesa D Singh , Anmol Bains , Terri Rodak , Brendan F Andrade ",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,2021 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Child,Emigrants and Immigrants*,Humans,Minority Groups,Parenting,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34196894

However, there has been no comprehensive systematic review assessing the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine (HM) on PSI. This protocol was developed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the evidence related to the efficacy and safety of HM on PSI. Methods: We will perform a comprehensive electronic search, including Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, AMED, CINAHL, PsycARTICLES, and Chinese, Korean, and Japanese databases from their inception to November 2020. This systemic review will include only randomized controlled clinical trials of HM on PSI. The main outcome is the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. Two researchers will independently screen citations and abstracts, identify full-text articles for inclusion, extract data, and appraise the quality and risk of bias of included studies. A meta-analysis will be conducted using Review Manager 5.4. The evidence quality of each outcome will be appraised according to Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Results: This protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-P (PRISMA-P) guidelines to ensure clarity and completeness of reporting in all phases of the systematic review. Conclusion: This study will provide evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of HM for the treatment of PSI.

232,For which younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder does parent-mediated intervention work?,"In this second of two primary papers, we examined two pre-intervention characteristics that might describe for whom a parent-implemented intervention, ""Improving Parents As Communication Teachers,"" worked. Investigators randomized 97 high-risk siblings and their primary parent to either the Improving Parents As Communication Teachers or control group, used intent-to-treat analysis, and used assessors and coders who were blinded to group assignment. We predicted that a combined risk score (incorporating young siblings' sex, multiplex status, and behavioral risk) would describe the subgroup for whom Improving Parents As Communication Teachers affected the targeted skills related to reducing communication challenges. We also predicted that pre-intervention level of parents' depressive symptoms would describe the parents whose parenting stress and effectiveness as parents would be improved by learning to use Improving Parents As Communication Teachers. In girls with only one older sibling with autism spectrum disorder and who scored at low risk on an autism spectrum disorder screen, parental receipt of Improving Parents As Communication Teachers training had an indirect effect on children's expressive language ability or autism spectrum disorder diagnosis through earlier effects on high-risk siblings' intentional communication or expressive vocabulary. We did not confirm our prediction regarding Improving Parents As Communication Teachers' effect on parenting-related stress or sense of parenting effectiveness.","Affiliations 1 Vanderbilt University, USA. 2 University of Washington, USA. 3 Harvard Medical School, USA. 4 Boston Children's Hospital, USA.","Paul J Yoder , Wendy L Stone , Sarah R Edmunds ",Autism,2021 Jan,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Autism Spectrum Disorder*,Child,Communication,Female,Humans,Parenting,Parents,Siblings*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32811171
233,Herbal medicinal products for inflammatory bowel disease: A focus on those assessed in double-blind randomised controlled trials,"Inflammatory bowel disease patients frequently use herbal products as complementary or alternative medicines to current pharmacotherapies and obtain information on them mainly from the internet, social media, or unlicensed practitioners. Clinicians should therefore take a more active role and become knowledgeable of the mechanisms of action and potential drug interactions of herbal medicines for which evidence of efficacy is available. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of several herbal medicines have been studied in double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Evidence of efficacy is available for Andrographis paniculata extract; curcumin; a combination of myrrh, extract of chamomile flower, and coffee charcoal; and the Chinese herbal medicines Fufangkushen colon-coated capsule and Xilei san in patients with ulcerative colitis; and Artemisia absinthium extract and Boswellia serrata resin extract in patients with Crohn's disease. However, most of this evidence comes from single small RCTs with short follow-up, and the long-term effects and safety of their use have not yet been established. Thus, our findings indicate that further appropriately sized RCTs are necessary prior to the recommended use of these herbal medicines in therapy. In the meantime, increasing awareness of their use, and potential drug interactions among physicians may help to reduce unwanted effects and adverse disease outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Department of Gastroenterology and Clinical Medicine, Trinity Centre for Health Sciences, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. 2 Unità Operativa Complessa di Medicina Interna e Gastroenterologia, Dipartimento di Scienze Gastroenterologiche, Endocrino-Metaboliche e Nefro-Urologiche, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""A.

234,Non-REM and REM/paradoxical sleep dynamics across phylogeny,"All animals carefully studied sleep, suggesting that sleep as a behavioral state exists in all animal life. Such evolutionary maintenance of an otherwise vulnerable period of environmental detachment suggests that sleep must be integral in fundamental biological needs. Despite over a century of research, the knowledge of what sleep does at the tissue, cellular or molecular levels remain cursory. Currently, sleep is defined based on behavioral criteria and physiological measures rather than at the cellular or molecular level. Physiologically, sleep has been described as two main states, non-rapid eye moment (NREM) and REM/paradoxical sleep (PS), which are defined in the neocortex by synchronous oscillations and paradoxical wake-like activity, respectively. For decades, these two sleep states were believed to be defining characteristics of only mammalian and avian sleep. Recent work has revealed slow oscillation, silencing, and paradoxical/REM-like activities in reptiles, fish, flies, worms, and cephalopods suggesting that these sleep dynamics and associated physiological states may have emerged early in animal evolution. Here, we discuss these recent developments supporting the conservation of neural dynamics (silencing, oscillation, paradoxical activity) of sleep states across phylogeny.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 3 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA; INSERM 1024, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, France.

236,Contemporary aquaculture: implications for human nutrition,"Aquaculture is increasing the global supply of foods, and holds tremendous potential to address malnutrition and diet-related diseases. The species selected and feeds used affects the nutrients available from aquaculture. Progress in the development of novel and sustainable aquaculture feeds to reduce reliance on wild fisheries, feed fortification to increase nutrient content, and expansion of the diversity of aquatic species produced are key areas for continued research and development. Ultimately, the degree to which aquaculture will contribute to nutrition depends largely on who can access the fish produced, which will be shaped by production technology as well as trade and price dynamics. Finally, the contribution of aquaculture expansion to improving nutrition will be bounded by aquaculture's environmental sustainability.","Affiliations 1 Master of Public Health Program & Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, Cornell University, United States.

237,Ethical considerations and challenges in herbal drug trials with the focus on scientific validity and risk assessment,"Scientific validity and risk assessment are two main ethical issues which raise specific challenges and are unique to clinical trials investigating crude extracts/fractions from herbal materials. There are considerable challenges for both clinical investigators and ethics committee members in dealing with such issues, many of them remain unresolved, resulting in a large variation in ethical requirements, justification, and decisions. Despite a remarkable surge in herbal medicine research globally, a number of clinical investigators or even ethics committee members have limited confidence in dealing with related ethical issues. In this article, we extensively review and discuss the two main ethical issues (i.e., scientific validity and risk assessment) and highlight key considerations that are important for ethical review and justification for the conduct of herbal drug trials.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. 2 Musculoskeletal Science and Translational Research Center, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. 3 Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. 4 Department of Clinical Product Development, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.","Nut Koonrungsesomboon , Nimit Morakote , Juntra Karbwang ",Phytother Res,2020 Nov 22.,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33222352
238,The parenting experiences and needs of Asian primary caregivers of children with autism: A meta-synthesis,"Parents of children with autism are faced with higher risks of unemployment, divorce, and poorer mental health than parents of children with other disorders. Such parenting stress can be further exacerbated by cultural and environmental factors such as the more conservative and collectivistic Asian values. Therefore, this review identifies and synthesizes literature on the parenting experiences and needs of Asian primary caregivers of children with autism using a critical interpretive method. A qualitative meta-summary was conducted. Seven electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched from each database's date of inception to November 2018. In total, 44 studies were included in this review. Thirteen studies examined Asian immigrant parents' experiences, and 31 studies were done among Asia-based parents. Six domains were identified: ""personal parenting journey""; ""adaptation and coping strategies""; ""family, community, and social support""; ""experiences with healthcare, education, and social services""; ""future hopes and recommendations""; and ""unique experiences of immigrants."" The distinctive influence of religious beliefs, cultural values, and environmental factors on Asian parenting experiences were discussed, and recommendations were proposed to better meet the needs of parents with autistic children.","Affiliations 1 National University of Singapore, Singapore. 2 Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Norway. 3 National University Hospital, Singapore.","Shefaly Shorey , Esperanza D Ng , Gørill Haugan , Evelyn Law ",Autism,2020 Apr,"Meta-Analysis,Review,Asians / psychology*,Autistic Disorder*,Caregivers / psychology*,Child,Humans,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31718238
239,A Preliminary Report on Herbal Medicine Use Among Patients Hospitalized at Two-Large COVID-19 Treatment Centers in Uganda,"Introduction: Herbal medication use among patients with COVID-19 imposes a significant risk of drug-herbal interactions and adverse events. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with herbal medicine use among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 attending two large COVID-19 Treatment Units (CTU) in Uganda. Methods: A hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted recruiting patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the Mulago National Referral Hospital and Namboole Stadium CTUs. Chi-square or Fishers' exact test for categorical and Mann-Whitney U-test for numerical were used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. Results: The study was terminated early because of significant reduction in the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the closure of Namboole CTU. Of the anticipated 422 participants, we recruited 108 (25.6%). Of this, 58 (53.7%) were female, with a median age of 38 (range: 20-75) years. Forty-nine (45.4%) had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Fifty-eight (57.3%) of the participants had ever used herbal medicine and the majority had used them in the past 12 months (71.9%, n = 41) either before the diagnosis of COVID-19 (85.4%, n = 35) or after (36.6%, n = 15). Being vaccinated for COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-6.8, p = 0.005) and having attained tertiary level of education (aOR: 6.2, 95% CI: 1.7-23.1, p = 0.006), as well as the accessibility to herbalists (aOR: 31.2, 95% CI: 3.7-263.2, p = 0.002) were significantly associated with herbal medication use. The majority of participants reported some improvement after using herbal medicine (80.7%, n = 46) and their doctors or nurses asked almost half of the participants about herbal medicine use (49.5%, n = 53). Conclusion: The use of herbal medicines to treat or prevent COVID-19 among hospitalized patients is a widespread practice in Uganda amidst unpublished evidence of their safety and efficacy.","Affiliations 1 School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. 2 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Gulu University, Gulu, Uganda. 3 Department of Internal Medicine, Kiruddu National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. 4 Department of Internal Medicine, Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda.","Phillip Musoke , Jerom Okot , Vivien Nanfuka , Pius Rwamafa , Joseph Masajjage , Ivan Kisuule , Brandy Nantaayi , Nelson Ssewante , Felix Bongomin ",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,2021 Nov 12,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34803412
240,Parental mentalizing as a key resource for difficult transitions,"This commentary on Ruiz et al.'s study focuses on the relevance of parental mentalizing for child development within a transactional framework. This view takes into account what kind of challenges in the parent, in the infant, or in the interaction have effects on child development and if this mediated by parental mentalizing. Differences between maternal and paternal mentalizing seem unrelated to the general level of reflective functioning but strongly influenced by social roles of parents. However, more sophisticated measures of mentalizing are needed to better understand subtle problems with regard to a dimensional and multifaceted model of mentalizing as well as interactional processes. To master the transition to parenthood in challenging circumstances such as preterm birth, it would be especially valuable to know if one parent's lower mentalizing can be counterbalanced by higher mentalizing in the other parent.","Affiliation 1 Institute for Psychosocial Prevention, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.",Svenja Taubner ,Attach Hum Dev,2020 Feb,"Child Development*,Fathers / psychology,Humans,Infant,Mentalization*,Mothers / psychology,Object Attachment*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Sex Factors,Socioeconomic Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30836831
241,Chapter 11: Nutrigenomics and Oral Health,"The advent of the ""genomic era"" has allowed for nutrigenomics studies to be carried out, which aim to reveal whether there are interactions between the food we consume and our genetic make-up. In turn this information will provide the scientific basis for improved public health messages related to nutrition and diet. With the availability of high throughput, inexpensive and sometime ""bed-side"" technology, studies into the effect of diet on the aetiology of common oral diseases and oral conditions could now be easily carried out. It is becoming more and more convincing that interactions between genotype and diet are important in determining the risk of most if not all common complex diseases, and it is therefore highly probable that these interactions will be important in determining oral disease risk. A large body of data relating to nutritional genetic studies where the outcome measures have been markers of disease risk, provide proof of principle and highlight the importance of understanding these interactions, illustrating the potential impact dietary modification could have on oral health. These are areas of growth that need to be investigated further.","Affiliation 1 School of Dental Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, Ruth.valentine@ncl.ac.uk.",Ruth A Valentine ,Monogr Oral Sci,2020,"Review,Diet,Food,Nutrigenomics*,Nutritional Status,Oral Health*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31940613

We emphasized those studies that provided a causality assessment methodology, such as Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method scores. Our review includes reports of individual herbals, including Garcinia cambogia, green tea extract, kratom as well as classes such as performance enhancing supplements, Traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine and herbal contamination. Newly described herbals include ashwagandha, boldo, skyfruit, and 'Thermo gun'. Several studies discussing data from national registries, including the United States Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Network, Spanish DILI Registry, and Latin American DILI Network were incorporated. There has also been a continued interest in hepatoprotection, with promising use of herbals to counter hepatotoxicity from anti-tubercular medications. We also elucidated the current legal conversation surrounding use of herbals by presenting updates from the Federal Drug Administration.

243,THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF PERSONALIZED NUTRITION,"In recent decades, there has been an increase in the presence of metabolic disorders associated with obesity. Central in the treatment of these conditions, including abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, dietary strategies play an important role. However, dietary recommendations are based on the generalization of nutrient or food intake response for all individuals, which not necessarily impacts the health of all individuals. The concept of personalized nutrition or precision nutrition has been recently developed, which states that diet is not the only factor accountable for metabolic responses such as postprandial glucose peaks, but that other factors are also involved, one of the most important of which is the gut microbiota. Therefore, the future of nutritional interventions is to generate algorithms based on the type of food consumed, biochemical parameters, physical activity, genetic variability, and especially the gut microbiota to predict the type of diet a person requires according to his or her metabolic alterations.","Affiliation 1 Department of Nutrition Physiology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.","Nimbe Torres , Armando R Tovar ",Rev Invest Clin,2021,"Gastrointestinal Microbiome*,Glucose / metabolism,Humans,Lipid Metabolism,Nutrigenomics*,Nutritional Status,Precision Medicine*,Glucose",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34609363
244,"[Parental support, parental self-efficacy and borderline personality features in adolescents]","Background: Parenting an adolescent with borderline personality disorder (BPD) features can be challenging due to, for example, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity and/or self-destructive behavior. Parents confronted with challenging behavior of their child, may experience less parental-self-efficacy (PSE). Subsequently this lower PSE might strengthen the relationship between low parental support and BPD features. Aim: To increase our understanding of the association between parenting related factors and features of BPD in adolescents. Method: The sample consisted of 81 adolescents, in the age of 13-21, from a clinical population and their parents. Parents completed (online) questionnaires on parental self-efficacy and adolescents reported on parental support and BPD features. Results: Adolescents who experienced lower parental support reported more BPD features. Lower parental self-efficacy was not related to BPD features in adolescence, but (more) self-efficacy was related to (older) age. Subsequently no evidence was found for a combined effect of perceived parental support and parental self-efficacy on adolescent BPD features. Conclusion: Adolescents in a clinical population with higher levels of BPD perceived lower levels of parental support. Parental self-efficacy was not related to levels of BPD. This research is a first step in understanding parenting related factors and BPD features.

245,Are food parenting practices gendered? Impact of mothers' and fathers' practices on their child's eating behaviors,"Past research has mainly focused on the links between child eating behaviors and maternal food practices. The impact of fathers and of concordant/discordant food parenting practices within families has received much less attention. To fill this gap, both parents of 105 French children aged 2.01-6.51 years (54 boys, Mage = 3.88 years, SD = 1.40) filled in a survey with items from validated questionnaires. Results showed that fathers and mothers perceived their child's eating behaviors in similar ways (Pearson correlations between 0.34 and 0.78; M = 0.60), despite mothers taking significantly more meals with their child than fathers. Fathers reported using significantly more pressure to eat and food as reward, but reported lower levels of ""family meal setting"" than mothers. Moderate to high correlations were observed between mothers' and fathers' feeding practices and styles. Regression analyses showed that both maternal and paternal practices and styles were predictors for child eating behaviors. One interaction effect was observed: in households where both parents used higher levels of pressure to eat, the child showed a significantly lower food enjoyment than expected if the effects were additive. Our findings underline the importance of studying the individual role of each parent in child feeding research and that both parents within families should avoid using coercive practices. This could finally stimulate new interventions and recommendations addressed to both parents.","Affiliations 1 Centre des Sciences du Goût et de l'Alimentation, AgroSup Dijon, CNRS, INRAE, Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Dijon, France.

246,Gender-Specific Differences in Corporal Punishment and Children's Perceptions of Their Mothers' and Fathers' Parenting,"Corporal punishment is a widespread phenomenon and a common malformation of parenting. Gender is a core category of social order and family structure. Gender-specific differences in parenting and violent behavior have been studied for many years. Yet, relatively little is known about the impact of gender interactions on parent-to-child physical violence or the impact of such violence on children's perceptions of their parents' behavior. This study used data collected from 618 students in academic institutions in northern Israel to examine the relationship between different gender interactions (e.g., mother-daughter, mother-son, father-daughter, and father-son) and the frequency of corporal punishment experienced by the respondents when they were in elementary school (between the ages 6 and 12). This study also examined whether gender interactions influence the relationship between corporal punishment and respondents' perceptions of their parents' behavior, namely the perceived parenting the respondents received during childhood. Cross tabulations and repeated measures were used to analyze the data. Significantly fewer daughters (as compared with sons) experienced corporal punishment and significantly fewer daughters experienced corporal punishment from both parents. Corporal punishment had a significant negative impact on the perceived parent-child relationship. Violent parental behavior had a significantly stronger effect on the perception of the father-child relationship, as compared with the perception of the mother-child relationship, even when the mother was the violent parent. These findings point to the importance of gender interactions in research and psychosocial practice.","Affiliation 1 University of Haifa, Israel.",David Mehlhausen-Hassoen ,J Interpers Violence,2021 Aug,"Child,Fathers,Female,Humans,Israel,Male,Mothers,Parenting*,Perception,Punishment*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30973047
247,Tuning into the real effect of smartphone use on parenting: a multiverse analysis,"Background: Concerns have been raised regarding the potential negative impacts of parents' smartphone use on the parent-child relationship. A scoping literature review indicated inconsistent effects, arguably attributable to different conceptualizations of parent phone use and conflation of phone use with technological interference. Methods: Based on a sample of n = 3, 659 parents collected in partnership with a national public broadcaster, we conducted a multiverse analysis. We explored 84 different analytic choices to address whether associations were weak versus robust, and provide clearer direction for measurement, theory, and practice. Effects were assessed in relation to p values, effect sizes, and AIC; we further conducted a meta-analytic sensitivity check. Results: Direct associations between smartphone use and parenting were relatively weak and mixed. Instead, the relation between use and parenting depended on level of technological interference. This pattern was particularly robust for family displacement. At low levels of displacing time with family using technology, more smartphone use was associated with better (not worse) parenting. Conclusions: Our results indicate fragility in findings of risks for parental smartphone use on parenting; there were few concerns in this regard. Rather, at low levels of technological interference, more phone use was associated with higher parenting quality. Scholars should avoid generalized narratives of family risk and seek to uncover real effects of smartphone use on family outcomes across diverse households and contexts.","Affiliations 1 School of Applied Psychology, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Mount Gravatt, QLD, Australia. 2 Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA. 3 Arts, Education, Law Group, Griffith University, Mount Gravatt, QLD, Australia. 4 Environmental Futures Research Institute, Griffith University, Mount Gravatt, QLD, Australia. 5 Kulbardi Aboriginal Centre, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia. 6 School of Education, Edith Cowan University, Mount Lawley, WA, Australia. 7 National Centre for Student Equity in Higher Education, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia. 8 School of Psychology & Exercise Science, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia. 9 Science Unit, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Sydney, NSW, Australia.","Kathryn L Modecki , Samantha Low-Choy , Bep N Uink , Lynette Vernon , Helen Correia , Kylie Andrews ",J Child Psychol Psychiatry,2020 Aug,"Meta-Analysis,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Australia,Humans,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting* / psychology,Parents / psychology,Smartphone*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32638400

Participants included 75 young children with ASD (Time 1; mean age = 25.68 months) and their parents. Parenting stress that was related to parent's perceptions on child characteristics was found to predict externalizing behavioral problems in young children with ASD across two time points. However, behavioral problems in young children with ASD did not predict parenting stress.

249,Interventions to Empower Adults with Eating Disorders and Their Partners around the Transition to Parenthood,"The transition to parenthood is perceived as a stressful life event, when parents experience an immense change of their psychological focus and a reorientation of roles and responsibilities in the family system. This process may be even more challenging in the presence of a parental eating disorder history. This paper reviews the impact of parental eating disorders on the parents, the couple relationship, and their child during the perinatal period. A parental eating disorder is associated with more negative expectations of parental efficacy as well as specific difficulties in couple communication over the child's feeding, shape, and weight. Providers who better understand the effects of an eating disorder on parental functioning can more effectively intervene early on. We also present couple- or parent-based, empirically supported interventions for adults with eating disorders and their partners in the prenatal and postnatal periods: Uniting Couples in the treatment of Anorexia Nervosa (UCAN) and Uniting couples In the Treatment of Eating disorders (UNITE) both enhance recovery from the eating disorder through a couple-based intervention; the Maudsley Model of Treatment for Adults with Anorexia Nervosa (MANTRA) incorporates the support of partners, when appropriate; Parent-Based Prevention (PBP) focuses on improving parental functioning and reducing risk of negative parental and child outcomes. Finally, we discuss the clinical implications of addressing parental eating disorders and encourage more research on these families.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA. 2 Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology, Interdisciplinary Center, Herzliya, Israel. 3 Department of Psychiatry, UNC Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders, The University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC. 4 Department of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC. 5 Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.","Shiri Sadeh-Sharvit , Madeline R Sacks , Cristin D Runfola , Cynthia M Bulik , James D Lock ",Fam Process,2020 Dec,"Review,Adult,Empowerment*,Family Therapy / methods*,Feeding and Eating Disorders / psychology*,Feeding and Eating Disorders / therapy,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Parenting / psychology,Parents / psychology*,Sexual Partners / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31799711

Most of the NCDs including insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, and coronary heart disease are related to obesity and are called obesity-related NCDs (OR-NCDs). However, adipocytes can reduce OR-NCDs by secreting adiponectin. Adiponectin has an inverse relationship with body fat. Obese people have impairment in differentiating pre-adipocytes to adipocytes, the process facilitated by adiponectin. Adiponectin directly increases insulin sensitivity and reduces obesity-related insulin resistance by down-regulating hepatic glucose production and increasing fatty acid (FA) oxidation in skeletal muscle. Considering the various beneficial effects of adiponectin on health, increasing adiponectin might be a promising approach to prevent and treat OR-NCDs. Recent studies have shown that nutraceuticals and medicinal compounds isolated from plants could prevent and treat various diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, to our knowledge, the effect of these natural products, including herbal supplements and functional foods on adiponectin, has not yet been fully reviewed. The main aim of this review is to summarize the effects of nutraceuticals and herbal bioactive compounds on plasma adiponectin concentrations based on clinical studies. It can be concluded that medicinal plants, and herbal bioactive compounds, particularly curcumin, anthocyanins, resveratrol, soy, walnut, and dihydromyricetin can be used as adjunct or complementary therapeutic agents to increase plasma adiponectin, which could potentially prevent and treat NCDs.","Affiliations 1 Student Research Committee, Department of Clinical Nutrition, School of Nutrition and Food Science, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. 2 Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutrition and Food Science, Food Security Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. 3 Dental research center, Department of Periodontics, Dental research institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. 4 Academic Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, UK. 5 Applied Biomedical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. sahebkara@mums.ac.ir. 6 Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. sahebkara@mums.ac.ir. 7 School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. sahebkara@mums.ac.ir. 8 School of Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. sahebkara@mums.ac.ir.","Mohammad Amin Atazadegan , Mohammad Bagherniya , Omid Fakheran , Thozhukat Sathyapalan , Amirhossein Sahebkar ",Adv Exp Med Biol,2021,"Review,Adiponectin,Anthocyanins,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2*,Herbal Medicine,Humans,Insulin Resistance*,Plants, Medicinal*,Adiponectin,Anthocyanins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981470
254,Precision (Personalized) Nutrition: Understanding Metabolic Heterogeneity,"People differ in their requirements for and responses to nutrients and bioactive molecules in the diet. Many inputs contribute to metabolic heterogeneity (including variations in genetics, epigenetics, microbiome, lifestyle, diet intake, and environmental exposure). Precision nutrition is not about developing unique prescriptions for individual people but rather about stratifying people into different subgroups of the population on the basis of biomarkers of the above-listed sources of metabolic variation and then using this stratification to better estimate the different subgroups' dietary requirements, thereby enabling better dietary recommendations and interventions. The hope is that we will be able to subcategorize people into ever-smaller groups that can be targeted in terms of recommendations, but we will never achieve this at the individual level, thus, the choice of precision nutrition rather than personalized nutrition to designate this new field. This review focuses mainly on genetically related sources of metabolic heterogeneity and identifies challenges that need to be overcome to achieve a full understanding of the complex interactions between the many sources of metabolic heterogeneity that make people differ from one another in their requirements for and responses to foods. It also discusses the commercial applications of precision nutrition.","Affiliation 1 Nutrition Research Institute, Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Kannapolis, North Carolina 28081, USA; email: steven_zeisel@unc.edu.",Steven H Zeisel ,Annu Rev Food Sci Technol,2020 Mar 25,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Review,Environmental Exposure,Epigenesis, Genetic,Genetic Variation,Humans,Nutrigenomics,Nutritional Status*,Precision Medicine*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928426
255,Drug-induced cystitis caused by herbal medicine (Bofutsushosan),"Bofutsushosan (BTS), one of many traditional Japanese medicines (Kampo medicines) is attracting attention for obesity and metabolic syndrome. We report allergic cystitis caused by 8-year BTS usage in a 70-year-old female. The patient presented with micturition pain with sterile pyuria over a 3-month period. Cystoscopy showed diffuse urothelial erythema and edema. Urine cytology specimens showed increased eosinophilic cells. By discontinuing BTS, the cystitis symptoms disappeared after 4 days, and urinalysis normalized. Resuming BTS without physician approval resulted in cystitis symptoms and after cessation the symptoms rapidly subsided. This is the first English case report linking allergic cystitis to herbal medicine.","Affiliations 1 Department of Female Urology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan. 2 Department of Urology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.","Kumiko Kato , Aika Matsushita , Shoji Suzuki , Hiroki Sai , Hiroki Hirabayashi , Ryohei Hattori ",Urol Case Rep,2021 Mar 19,Case Reports,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33850729
256,Traditional East Asian herbal medicines for the treatment of poststroke constipation: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis,"Background: Post-stroke constipation is a major complication of stroke and increases the incidence of poor neurological outcomes and infectious complications and, therefore, warrants active and prompt treatment. In East Asian countries, several types of herbal medicines have been used for the treatment of post-stroke constipation because they are considered safer than existing pharmacotherapies. However, no systematic review has investigated the efficacy and safety of traditional East Asian herbal medicine in the treatment of post-stroke constipation. With this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of traditional East Asian herbal medicines for the treatment of post-stroke constipation. Methods and analysis: Eight electronic databases will be searched for relevant studies published from inception to April 2021. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the efficacy and safety of traditional East Asian herbal medicines for the treatment of post-stroke constipation will be included in this study. The methodological qualities, including the risk of bias, will be evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. After screening the studies, a meta-analysis of the RCTs will be performed, if possible. Results: This study is expected to generate high-quality evidence of the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines to treat post-stroke constipation. Conclusion: Our systematic review will provide evidence to determine whether herbal medicines can be effective interventions for patients with post-stroke constipation. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval is not required, as this study was based on a review of published research. This review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated electronically and in print.

257,Applications of Herbal Medicine to Treat Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common hereditary kidney disease, which is featured by progressively enlarged bilateral fluid-filled cysts. Enlarging cysts destroy the structure of nephrons, ultimately resulting in the loss of renal function. Eventually, ADPKD develops into end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Currently, there is no effective drug therapy that can be safely used clinically. Patients progressed into ESRD usually require hemodialysis and kidney transplant, which is a heavy burden on both patients and society. Therefore, looking for effective therapeutic drugs is important for treating ADPKD. In previous studies, herbal medicines showed their great effects in multiple diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and mental disorders, which also might play a role in ADPKD treatment. Currently, several studies have reported that the compounds from herbal medicines, such as triptolide, curcumin, ginkolide B, steviol, G. lucidum triterpenoids, Celastrol, saikosaponin-d, Sparganum stoloniferum Buch.-Ham and Cordyceps sinensis, contribute to the inhibition of the development of renal cysts and the progression of ADPKD, which function by similar or different mechanisms. These studies suggest that herbal medicines could be a promising type of drugs and can provide new inspiration for clinical therapeutic strategy for ADPKD. This review summarizes the pharmacological effects of the herbal medicines on ADPKD progression and their underlying mechanisms in both in vivo and in vitro ADPKD models.","Affiliations 1 State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China. 2 Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Sciences, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.","Guangying Shao , Shuai Zhu , Baoxue Yang ",Front Pharmacol,2021 Apr 27,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33986666

260,The influence of youth and parent reports of parental knowledge and monitoring and reporting discrepancy on high risk youth offending,"Introduction: Positive parenting practices are known to be related to lower levels of youth offending. Questions remain as to the overlap between youth and parent perceptions of parenting practices, and the relationship of perception discrepancies with youth offending. This study examines the concordance of parenting behaviors reports, the relationship between parent and youth perceptions of parenting measures with youth offending, and whether discordant youth and parent reports are related to heterogeneity in youth offending. Methods: Survey data from 818 high risk U.S. youth averaging 16 years old who participated in the Pathways to Desistance study and his or her parent form the basis of this analysis. Results and conclusions: Results demonstrate youth and parent reports of parental knowledge and parental monitoring are correlated, yet independent predictors of youth offending variety scores. Youth and parent reports about parenting measures demonstrate youth offending is highest when youth perceive parents as uninvolved, and lowest when youth estimates of parental knowledge and monitoring are higher than parent estimates. Parenting matters for high-risk youth, especially in reducing the likelihood of property offending. Using multiple perspectives to assess parenting practices is important in studying these dyadic relationships.","Affiliations 1 Professor and Chair Department of Sociology Iowa State University, Box 1054, Ames, IA, 50011-1054, United States.

262,Early and Synergistic Recovery Effect of Herbal Combination on Surgically Corrected Varicocele,"Context: Not all men presenting varicocele-associated infertility exhibit improved sperm quality or achieve pregnancy following varicocelectomy. Some combinations of specific natural herbs have been shown empirically to reduce oxidative stress and improve sperm quality. Objective: We conducted a study to determine the effects of an herbal combination on sperm quality in varicocele-induced rats following varicocelectomy, hoping to find a new treatment approach to restore sperm quality following varicocelectomy. Design: The research team designed an animal study. Setting: The study took place in the Department of Urology at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea). Animals: Fifty white, male, Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 to 300 g each were used in the study. Intervention: The rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups: (1) a control group (n = 10), (2) varicocele group (n = 10), (3) rats with varicocele and receiving varicocelectomy only (varicocelectomy group, n = 10), (4) rats with varicocele received varicocelectomy and oral administration with 200 mg/kg of an herbal combination for 4 wk (varicocelectomy + 200 mg/kg group, n = 10), and (5) rats with varicocele received varicocelectomy and oral administration with 400 mg/kg of an herbal com for 4 wk (varicocelectomy + 400 mg/kg group, n = 10). Outcome measures: The study measured (1) sperm concentration and motility, (2) levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), (3) concentrations of interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), (4) apoptotic change, and (5) levels of heat shock protein (HSP). Results: The sperm concentrations and motilities recovered after treatment in the varicocelectomy, varicocelectomy + 200 mg/kg, and varicocelectomy + 400 mg/kg groups. Significantly increased SOD and decreased ROS and cytokine levels were also observed. The apoptosis in the testes also was significantly decreased compared with the varicocele group. HSP70 in groups received varicocelectomy and administered with herbal combination was significantly decreased compared with the varicocelectomy group. Conclusions: The herbal combination was found to improve the sperm qualities, oxidative stress, and inflammation after varicocelectomy. Therefore, the herbal combination may provide a new and additional treatment for varicocele-associated infertility.

264,"A Dyadic Analysis of Depressive Symptoms, Harsh Parenting, and Rejection in Filipino Mothers and Fathers","This study examines within-person and cross-person relations between depressive symptoms, harsh parenting, and parental rejection in low-income Filipino mothers and fathers of adolescents using an actor-partner interdependence model (APIM). Mother and father dyads (N = 81, Mage = 43.48, SD = 8.66) recruited from urban neighborhoods in the Philippines completed orally administered questionnaires on depressive symptoms, harsh parenting, and rejection. Results showed that mothers' scores and fathers' scores on depressive symptoms did not significantly differ and that mothers scored significantly higher than fathers on harsh parenting and rejection. Dyadic analyses using the APIM showed that the actor effect of depressive symptoms on harsh parenting was statistically significant for fathers only and that the actor effects of depressive symptoms on rejection were statistically significant for both mothers and fathers. No partner effects on harsh parenting and rejection were statistically significant. These findings contribute to the robust evidence linking parental depressive symptoms to negative parenting behaviors and highlight the need to attend to both fathers' psychological health and mothers' psychological health in efforts to reduce harsh and rejecting parenting behaviors among Filipino parents.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychology, Ateneo de Manila University, Quezon City, Philippines.",Rosanne M Jocson ,Fam Process,2021 Jun,"Adolescent,Adult,Depression,Female,Humans,Mothers*,Parenting*,Parents,Philippines",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32479660
265,Different Chinese herbal medicine therapy for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: A protocol for systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis,"Background: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common immune system and blood system disease in clinical practice, and it is a hemorrhagic disease caused by immune factors causing platelet destruction and decreasing number of platelets. There is currently no effective treatment plan for ITP. At this stage, glucocorticoid and gamma globulin are mostly used in the treatment of ITP, and some patients use splenectomy to achieve therapeutic purposes, but the various treatment methods are inadequate. At this stage, a large number of randomized controlled studies have reported that Chinese herbal medicine has achieved good curative effect in the treatment of ITP. However, due to the variety of Chinese herbal medicine, there has been no evidence of the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of ITP. Because of the above reasons, this study uses the network meta-analysis method based on Bayesian method to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of different kinds of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of ITP through direct and indirect comparison, in order to provide evidence-based medical support for the treatment of ITP with Chinese herbal medicine. Methods: This study uses the method of combining free words with theme words, and using computer to retrieve PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, WANFANG Database, CNKI, and VIP Database, etc, to collect the randomized control studies on Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of ITP. The retrieval time is from the establishment of each database to January 2021, and the retrieval languages are Chinese and English. Two researchers independently read the title, abstract and full text of the article to determine whether it is included in the literature; In the event of a disagreement, a third researcher will join the discussion to resolve the disagreement; For the literature that lacks information, trying to contact the original author of the document to supplement it. The literature quality evaluation carried out by using the Stata 14.0 software to draw network and funnel plots, in accordance with the quality evaluation criteria of version 5.1.0 of the Cochrane System Evaluation Manual. Statistical analysis is performed by using ADDIS 1.16.8 software based on the Bayesian model. Results: This study will compare the clinical efficacy and safety of different types of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura through the method of network meta-analysis, and rank the different types of Chinese herbal medicine according to their effectiveness, and the results will be published in a peer-reviewed, high-quality academic journal. Conclusion: This study will find effective and safe Chinese herbal medicine for clinical treatment of ITP from the perspective of evidence-based medicine, and benefit more ITP patients.","Affiliation 1 Department of Hematology, Hainan General Hospital (Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University), Xiuying District, Haikou City, Hainan Province, China.","Wen-Ting Chen , Rui-Mei Tang, Ying Huang, Yan-Ping Pan, Shu-Wen Wang, Gu-Yun Wang",Medicine (Baltimore),2021 Apr 2,"Comparative Study,Bayes Theorem,Drugs, Chinese Herbal / administration & dosage*,Drugs, Chinese Herbal / adverse effects,Evidence-Based Medicine / methods,Humans,Network Meta-Analysis,Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic / drug therapy*,Systematic Reviews as Topic,Treatment Outcome,Drugs, Chinese Herbal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33787633

Acute oral toxicity study as per OECD 425 TG was conducted. For validation of anti-asthmatic claim, in vivo assay named Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine method in Wistar rats was used. Eosinophils and IgE antibody were quantified post-administration of low and high doses of the formulations. No mortality was observed in acute toxicity study. Elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and damaged liver structure indicating the hepatotoxicity were more pronounced in PH 2 treated rats. Congestion in kidney tissue and increased urea level were evident of the nephrotoxic nature of PH 2 in animals. Treatment with selected polyherbal products decreased the MDA level while increasing the SOD and GSH levels in lung tissue homogenates. The maximum decrease in IgE load (3.18 ± 0.08 IU/mL) was found in rats treated with 12 mg/kg dose of PH 1 followed by 100 mg/kg dose of PH 2 (3.44 ± 0.06 IU/mL). It was concluded that both polyherbal formulations had anti-asthmatic activities, however, PH 1 exhibited the liver and kidney toxicity and should be cautiously used.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University Faisalabad, 38000, Pakistan. 2 Riphah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Riphah International University Lahore, 54000, Pakistan.","Uzma Saleem , Maryam Usman , Fareeha Anwar , Muhammad Furqan Akhtar , Bashir Ahmad ",An Acad Bras Cienc,2020 Oct 12,"Animals,Anti-Asthmatic Agents* / toxicity,Herbal Medicine,Liver* / drug effects,Lung,Mice,Plant Extracts* / toxicity,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Anti-Asthmatic Agents,Plant Extracts",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33053107
268,Exploring Herbal Medicine Use during Palliative Cancer Care: The Integrative Physician as a Facilitator of Pharmacist-Patient-Oncologist Communication,"Oncology patients frequently use herbal and other forms of complementary medicine, often without the knowledge of oncologists, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals responsible for their care. Oncology healthcare professionals may lack the knowledge needed to guide their patients on the safe and effective use of herbal medicinal products, a number of which have potentially harmful effects, which include direct toxicity and negative herb-drug interactions. The current review addresses the prevalence and expectations of oncology patients from herbal medicine, as well as evidence for the beneficial or harmful effects of this practice (potential and actual), especially when the herbal products are used in conjunction with anticancer agents. Models of integrative oncology care are described, in which open and effective communication among oncologists, pharmacists, and integrative physicians on the use of herbal medicine by their patients occurs. This collaboration provides patients with a nonjudgmental and multidisciplinary approach to integrative medicine, echoing their own health-belief models of care during conventional cancer treatments. The role of the integrative physician is to facilitate this process, working with oncologists and pharmacists in the fostering of patient-centered palliative care, while ensuring a safe and effective treatment environment.

273,Current Utilization and Research Status of Traditional East Asian Herbal Medicine Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis: A Scoping Review,"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that is gradually increasing in prevalence. The etiology of MS remains unknown; however, it is assumed to be caused by a deterioration of autoimmune regulation. Although immunomodulatory agents are a standard treatment option in patients with MS, there is insufficient evidence about their clinical efficacy in symptomatic treatment, and many MS patients resort to complementary and alternative medicine. For this reason, we conducted a scoping review to investigate the current status of the clinical evidence related to traditional East Asian herbal medicine treatment for MS and to inform future research and treatment strategies. Method: A scoping review is an emerging methodology for knowledge synthesis that adopts the Arksey and O'Malley framework. The research question was, ""What has been studied about the herbal medicine treatments administered to patients with MS?"" Articles published until 2019 were identified in six databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, KoreaMed, NDSL, and OASIS) in March of 2020. Data from the included studies were charted and descriptively analyzed in relation to the study's research questions. Results: Of the 1,445 articles identified, 14 studies were included in this review. Single and serial case reports constituted the majority (42.86%), with 57.14% of studies conducted in China. A total of 20 prescriptions containing 95 herbs were used in the intervention and observational studies. Herbal medicines were effective at improving clinical symptoms of MS and reducing recurrence frequency. The main cause of MS was presumed to be oxidative stress, which enhances inflammation and, consequently, causes neuronal death. Conclusion: Herbal medicines were determined to improve the symptoms of MS and to reduce the frequency of recurrences. This study suggests that herbal medicines are promising and worth pursuing further studies but the state of current evidence is poor. Thus, further, high-quality studies included larger randomized trial are required.","Affiliations 1 Department of Korean Medicine Cardiology and Neurology, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea. 2 Department of Cardiology and Neurology, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.","Yuna Seo , Chul Jin , Seung-Yeon Cho , Seong-Uk Park , Woo-Sang Jung , Sang-Kwan Moon , Jung-Mi Park , Chang-Nam Ko , Ki-Ho Cho , Seungwon Kwon ",Front Neurol,2021 Oct 18,Systematic Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34733228
274,Narrative review of interventions suitable for well-baby clinics to promote infant attachment security and parents' sensitivity,"Aim: The aim of this narrative review was to evaluate the evidence for interventions for children's secure attachment relationships and parents' caregiving sensitivity that could potentially be implemented in the context of a well-baby clinic. Methods: Literature search on programmes for parental caregiving sensitivity and secure attachment for infants aged 0-24 months. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published 1995-2018 with interventions starting from one week postpartum, and with a maximum of 12 sessions (plus potential booster session) were included. Results: We identified 25 studies, of which 22 studied effects of home-based programmes using video feedback techniques. Positive effects of these interventions in families at risk were found on parental caregiving sensitivity and to a lesser extent also on children's secure or disorganised attachment. The effects of two of these programmes were supported by several RCTs. Three intervention studies based on group and individual psychotherapy showed no significant positive effects. Most of the interventions targeted mothers only. Conclusion: The review found some evidence for positive effects of selective interventions with video feedback techniques for children's secure attachment and strong evidence for positive effects on parental caregiving sensitivity. Important knowledge gaps were identified for universal interventions and interventions for fathers and parents with a non-Western background.","Affiliations 1 Sachs' Children and Youth Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. 2 Department of Medicine, Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. 3 CHESS, Centre for Health Equity Studies, Stockholm University and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. 4 Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. 5 Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet & Center for Epidemiology and Community Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden.","Malin Bergström , Mihretab Gebreslassie , Maria Hedqvist , Lene Lindberg , Anna Sarkadi , Anders Hjern ",Acta Paediatr,2020 Sep,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Child,Child, Preschool,Fathers,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Male,Mothers*,Object Attachment,Parenting,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32027407
275,Nano-based delivery systems for berberine: A modern anti-cancer herbal medicine,"Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid belonging to the structural class of protoberberines. BBR has been used in traditional medicine to treat diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. BBR inhibits cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis. However, BBR has significant drawbacks as a chemotherapeutic agent, including poor solubility, and induction of drug resistance, limiting its application in chemotherapy. Hence, combination therapy could not only deal with the problems related to single-agent chemotherapy but could also improve the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs. Co-administration of drugs may show pharmaceutical incompatibility due to conflicting physicochemical features. BBR can be used in nanoparticle-based single drug delivery, and in co-delivery systems designed to accommodate drugs and deliver them simultaneously into cancer cells. In this review, we will summarize the use of BBR, including BBR as a single chemotherapeutic agent and the combination of BBR with traditional anti-cancer drugs or herbal medicines in nanoparticle-based delivery systems.","Affiliations 1 Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Department of Persian Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. 2 Department of Persian Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. 3 Pharmaceutical Analysis Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. 4 Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

276,The use of complementary and alternative medicine among hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients in Western Jamaica: A mixed methods study,"Background: The simultaneous or intermittent use of alternative treatments and prescription medications for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus can have adverse health effects. Objectives: To identify beliefs and practices associated with the use of alternative treatments for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus among patients. Methods: A mixed-methods study including an investigator-administered survey and focus group discussion sessions using convenience sampling was conducted among patients aged ≥18 years during May to August 2018. Descriptive statistics were used to describe and compare demographic characteristics among groups of survey participants using JMP Pro 14.0. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyze the qualitative data using NVivo. Results: Most study participants (87-90%) were on prescription medication for their condition. Of survey participants, 69% reported taking their medication as prescribed and 70% felt that prescription medicine was controlling their condition. Almost all participants (98%) reported using alternative treatments, mainly herbal medications, and 73-80% felt that herbal medicines controlled their conditions. One-third believed that herbal medicines are the most effective form of treatment and should always be used instead of prescription medication. However, most participants (85%) did not believe that prescription and herbal treatments should be used simultaneously. Most (76-90%) did not discuss herbal treatments with their healthcare providers. Four themes emerged from the focus group sessions: 1) Simultaneous use of herbal and prescription medicine was perceived to be harmful, 2) Patients did not divulge their use of herbal medicine to healthcare providers, 3) Alternative medicines were perceived to be highly effective, and 4) Religiosity and family elders played key roles in herbal use. Conclusions: This study provides useful insights into perceptions and use of alternative treatments by patients that can be used by healthcare providers in developing appropriate interventions to encourage proper use of prescription medicines and alternative medicines resulting in improved management of these chronic diseases.","Affiliations 1 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America. 2 Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America. 3 Epidemiology Unit, Western Regional Health Authority, Ministry of Health, Montego Bay, St. James, Jamaica. 4 Health Services Administration, School of Health Professions, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America.","Omolade Adeniyi , LaTimberly Washington , Christina J Glenn , Sarah G Franklin , Anniecia Scott , Maung Aung , Soumya J Niranjan , Pauline E Jolly ",PLoS One,2021 Feb 8,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Complementary Therapies / methods,Complementary Therapies / statistics & numerical data,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / therapy*,Female,Focus Groups,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice / ethnology*,Herbal Medicine / statistics & numerical data,Herbal Medicine / trends,Humans,Hypertension / therapy*,Jamaica / epidemiology,Male,Medication Adherence,Middle Aged,Phytotherapy / statistics & numerical data,Plants, Medicinal,Prescription Drugs / therapeutic use,Surveys and Questionnaires,Prescription Drugs",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33556053
277,Use of herbal medicine for diabetes mellitus in adults from the central-western region of Mexico,"Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of herbal medicine (HM) use and factors influencing HM usage including the identification of the main plants consumed by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in central-western Mexico. Design: A total of 1862 patients with diabetes were surveyed in public and private hospitals in four states (Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacan, and San Luis Potosi) of the central-western region of Mexico. The chi-square test was used to assess associations between HM use and demographic characteristics, such as glucose levels, presence of complications and comorbidities, as well as the selected therapy to treat T2DM. Results: The prevalence of HM use (59.2%) in patients with T2DM was mainly associated with education level (p = 0.001), time of diagnosis of T2DM (p = 0.004), presence of complications (p < 0.001) and comorbidities (p = 0.018) and the use of insulin (p < 0.001). These patients report a higher consumption of herbal medicine compared to those on glycemic control (p < 0.001). The most frequently used medicinal plants to treat T2DM were nopal (54.9%), moringa (26.7%), and aloe (22.1%). Conclusion: The prevalence of HM use to treat T2DM in west-central Mexico is high (59.2%) and its consumption is mostly carried out without the recommendation of a health professional (91.9%). The use of HM increases mainly when the patient uses insulin, during complications of the disease or in patients with an inadequate glycemic control.","Affiliations 1 Departamento de Ciencias Médicas, División de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Guanajuato, León, Guanajuato, Mexico. 2 Departamento de Farmacia, División de Ciencias Naturales y Exactas, Universidad de Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico.

278,Epigenetic Studies of Chinese Herbal Medicine: Pleiotropic Role of DNA Methylation,"Accumulating knowledge has been achieved on DNA methylation participating in numerous cellular processes and multiple human diseases; however, few studies have addressed the pleiotropic role of DNA methylation in Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). CHM has been used worldwide for the prevention and treatment of multiple diseases. Newly developed epigenetic techniques have brought great opportunities for the development of CHM. In this review, we summarize the DNA methylation studies and portray the pleiotropic role of DNA methylation in CHM. DNA methylation serves as a mediator participating in plant responses to environmental factors, and thus affecting CHM medicinal plants growth and bioactive compound biosynthesis which are vital for therapeutic effects. Furthermore, DNA methylation helps to uncover the pharmaceutical mechanisms of CHM formulae, herbs, and herbal-derived compounds. It also provides scientific validation for constitution theory and other essential issues of CHM. This newly developed field of DNA methylation is up-and-coming to address many complicated scientific questions of CHM; it thus not only promotes disease treatment but also facilitates health maintenance.","Affiliations 1 School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China. 2 National Institute of TCM Constitution and Preventive Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China. 3 Tang Center for Herbal Medicine Research, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States. 4 Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.","Wenqian Guo , Han Ma , Chong-Zhi Wang , Jin-Yi Wan , Haiqiang Yao , Chun-Su Yuan ",Front Pharmacol,2021 Dec 7,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950039
279,"Promoting sensitive parenting in 'at-risk' mothers and fathers: A UK outcome study of Mellow Babies, a group-based early intervention program for parents and their babies","Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Mellow Babies (MB) in the UK. MB is a 14-week early parenting intervention program that is delivered in groups and is targeted at 'at-risk' parents (both mothers and fathers) and their babies up to 18 months old. Method: The study used a pragmatic pre-post intervention design. Outcomes were parental mental health, parenting confidence, quality of life, socio-emotional development of children, and perceived parent-child relationship. Fifteen groups representing n = 91 parent-baby dyads were recruited across the UK between 2017-2018. The sample consisted of 10 Mellow Mums groups (70 mother-baby dyads) and 5 Mellow Dads groups (21 father-baby dyads). Intention-to-treat and 'completer' analyses were performed. Results: Findings suggest short-term positive outcomes for parents attending MB. Completion of the program was associated with significant improvements in anxiety and overall wellbeing, parenting confidence, and perceived closeness of the parent-child relationship. The significance of these improvements, except for parenting confidence, was maintained in the intention-to-treat analysis. MB engaged and retained a high proportion of parents who could be considered 'at-risk' and benefitted fathers and mothers attending the intervention equally. Conclusions: This is the first prospective study to explore MB participation for both mothers and fathers and to indicate engagement and potential benefits specifically for 'at-risk' parents. Findings further demonstrate the effectiveness of MB as an early intervention program for parents experiencing psychosocial difficulties. Replication by studies using a contrast or control group also incorporating follow-up data would further improve the evidence base for MB.","Affiliations 1 Mellow Parenting, Glasgow, United Kingdom. 2 Department of Clinical Psychology, School of Health in Social Science, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.","Aigli Raouna , Ruaridh Malcolm , Raquib Ibrahim , Angus MacBeth ",PLoS One,2021 Feb 3,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Male,Mental Health*,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / education*,Parents / psychology,Quality of Life / psychology*,United Kingdom",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33534841
280,Negative parenting behaviour as a mediator of the effects of telephone-assisted self-help for parents of pharmacologically treated children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"A previous randomised controlled trial demonstrated the effects of a telephone-assisted self-help (TASH) intervention for parents of pharmacologically treated children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on ADHD symptoms, oppositional symptoms, functional impairment, and negative parenting behaviour (per-protocol analyses). In the current study, we examined whether changes in positive and negative parenting behaviour mediated the effects on symptoms and impairment. Parents in an enhancement group (n = 51) participated in a 12-month TASH intervention (eight booklets plus up to 14 telephone consultations) as an adjunct to routine clinical care, whereas parents in a waitlist control group (n = 52) received routine clinical care only. Parents completed measures of child symptoms, child functional impairment, and parenting behaviour at baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months. The mediating effects of parenting behaviour were examined using regression analyses. Per-protocol analyses (n = 74) revealed a significant indirect intervention effect on functional impairment through negative parenting behaviour at 6 months as well as indirect intervention effects on oppositional symptoms and functional impairment through negative parenting behaviour at 12 months. The indirect effect on ADHD symptoms through negative parenting behaviour at 12 months just failed to reach significance. The analyses yielded no indirect intervention effects through positive parenting behaviour. The study provides some, albeit limited, support for the importance of changes in negative parenting behaviour to achieve changes in symptoms and functional impairment during parent training. In consideration of the inconsistent results of previous studies concerning the mediating role of positive and negative parenting behaviour, further research is required to better understand the mechanisms of change during parent training, also including other possible mediators like parenting stress and parental self-efficacy.","Affiliations 1 School for Child and Adolescent Cognitive Behavior Therapy (AKiP), Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Pohligstr. 9, 50969, Cologne, Germany.

281,Parental ADHD Symptoms and Inhibitory Control in Relation to Parenting Among Mothers of Children With and Without ADHD,"Objective: The study examined how the interplay between maternal ADHD symptoms and maternal inhibitory control and child ADHD is related to parenting behaviors. Method: The sample included 141 mothers and their 8- to 12-year-old children, 61 children with ADHD and 80 without. Parenting was measured using self-reports (i.e., overreactive and lax parenting) and observation (i.e., negative and supportive parenting). Maternal inhibitory control was measured using a neurocognitive task. Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to predict parenting, controlling for child sex, conduct behaviors, and parenting distress. Results: Interactions between maternal ADHD symptoms and maternal inhibitory control suggested that hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were linked to parenting negativity only when inhibitory control was low, and maternal inattention symptoms were related to lax parenting only when maternal inhibitory control was high or when children did not have ADHD. Conclusion: Results indicate the importance of maternal regulation processes in the mechanisms linking maternal ADHD with parenting.","Affiliations 1 Tel Aviv University, Israel. 2 The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.","Anat Zaidman-Zait , Iris Shilo ",J Atten Disord,2021 Feb,"Adult,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*,Child,Female,Humans,Impulsive Behavior,Mothers,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30442044

Participants and Methods: Between March and October 2016, a sample of 314 college students aged 18-25 completed a survey including their perceptions of their parent's active tracking efforts during high school and college. Items were then analyzed, and internally consistent measures were derived. Results: The new measures demonstrated significant convergent validity with the three sources of parental knowledge constructs (parental solicitation, parental control, and youth disclosure). Greater perceived parental active tracking efforts during adolescence and in college were associated with better health behaviors in both time periods. Conclusions: The newly derived measures represent appropriate and predictive indices of parental tracking behaviors during adolescence and college, designed specifically with these populations in mind, to be used in pre-intervention and intervention work with parents.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychology, The College at Brockport, Brockport, New York, USA.","Caitlin C Abar , Sarah Farnett , Kayla Mendola , Sharon Sarra , Gabrielle Clark ",J Am Coll Health,2021 Feb-Mar,"Adolescent,Adult,Health Behavior,Humans,Parenting*,Parents,Schools,Students*,Universities,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31498750

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a community-based ABC implementation in improving parent outcomes as well as to examine potential mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness. Two hundred parents and their 5- to 21-month-old infants recruited from an urban community were randomly assigned to receive ABC or be placed on a waitlist. The majority of participants had a minority racial or ethnic background. Before intervention, parents completed questionnaires about sociodemographic risk and adverse childhood experiences. At both baseline and follow-up, parents reported depression symptoms and were video-recorded interacting with their infant, which was coded for sensitivity. The ABC intervention predicted significant increases in parental sensitivity and, among parents who completed the intervention, significant decreases in depression symptoms. Changes in parental depression symptoms did not significantly mediate the intervention effects on sensitivity. Risk variables did not moderate the intervention effects. The results indicate that ABC shows promise for improving parent outcomes in community settings, supporting dissemination.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA. 2 Power of Two, Brooklyn, NY, USA.","Laura Perrone , Steven D Imrisek , Allison Dash , Melanie Rodriguez , Erasma Monticciolo , Kristin Bernard ",Dev Psychopathol,2021 Aug,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Depression*,Humans,Infant,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32662374
285,Alleviation of dry mouth by saliva substitutes improved swallowing ability and clinical nutritional status of post-radiotherapy head and neck cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial,"Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an edible saliva substitute, oral moisturizing jelly (OMJ), and a topical saliva gel (GC) on dry mouth, swallowing ability, and nutritional status in post-radiotherapy head and neck cancer patients. Methods: Sixty-two post-radiation head and neck cancer patients with xerostomia completed a blinded randomized controlled trial. They were advised to swallow OMJ (n = 31) or apply GC orally (n = 31) for 2 months. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 1, and 2 months, including subjective and objective dry mouth (Challcombe) scores, subjective swallowing problem scores (EAT-10), water swallowing time, clinical nutritional status (PG-SGA), body weight, and dietary intake. Results: After 1 and 2 months of interventions, subjective and objective dry mouth scores, subjective swallowing problem scores, swallowing times, and clinical nutritional status in both groups were significantly improved (p < 0.0001). Compared to GC, OMJ group had higher percent improvement in all outcome measures (p < 0.001) except swallowing time and clinical nutritional status. Interestingly, subjective dry mouth scores were significantly correlated with subjective swallowing problem scores (r = 0.5321, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Continuous uses of saliva substitutes (OMJ or GC) for at least a month improved signs and symptoms of dry mouth and enhanced swallowing ability. An edible saliva substitute was superior to a topical saliva gel for alleviating dry mouth and swallow problems. These lead to improved clinical nutritional status. Thus, palliation of dry mouth may be critical to support nutrition of post-radiotherapy head and neck cancer patients.

286,Validation and factor analysis of the parental bonding instrument in Japanese pregnant women,"The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) evaluates parental attitudes derived from an individual's childhood experiences with their parents. The factor structure of the PBI differs depending on variables such as psychosocial factors including culture, race, sex, and psychological and social conditions of participants. Although previous studies of the relationships between perinatal depression and parenting experiences have used the factor structures of the PBI from the general population, it is unclear whether the same factor structures are appropriate in the highly variable perinatal period. In this study, complete responses to the PBI and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were received from 932 primiparas at 25 weeks of gestation and at 1 month postpartum. An exploratory factor analysis was performed on half of the responses, and it was confirmed that the three factors were care, interference, and autonomy. Confirmatory factor analysis of the remaining half of the answers showed comprehensible fitness. Each factor showed a high degree of internal consistency, and each factor of the PBI correlated with the EPDS, indicating construct validity. The reliability and validity of the PBI in perinatal Japanese women were confirmed, and it was found that the PBI had a three-factor structure.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan. 2 Department of Psychiatry, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan. okada@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp. 3 Department of Medical Technique, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan. 4 Center of Advanced Medicine and Clinical Research, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8550, Japan.","Maya Sato , Takashi Okada , Mako Morikawa , Yukako Nakamura , Aya Yamauchi , Masahiko Ando , Norio Ozaki ",Sci Rep,2021 Jul 2,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Factor Analysis, Statistical,Female,Humans,Japan / epidemiology,Neonatal Nursing,Object Attachment,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Pregnancy,Pregnant Women / psychology*,Psychiatric Status Rating Scales,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34215793

288,Preconception nutrition: building advocacy and social movements to stimulate action,"Action to improve preconception nutrition is a collective, societal responsibility. We believe that the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) society is ideally placed to facilitate the development of a global agenda for preconception nutrition which recognises the societal importance of nutrition for young women and men, and supports them in optimising their nutritional status for the benefit of the next generation. In this paper, we outline four key actions that can be taken by the members of DOHaD's international society located across 67 countries, and nine regional societies, to demonstrate this leadership role. The recommended actions to place preconception nutrition at the top of national and regional agendas include (i) continuing to build the scientific evidence, (ii) monitoring of progress made by governments and commercial companies, (iii) developing advocacy coalitions that unite individuals and organisations around common policy options and (iv) working with partners to develop an emotive and empowering preconception nutrition awareness campaign. Collectively, these actions hold the potential to develop into a preconception nutrition social movement to invoke high-level government support and across-sector policy action, while raising public demand for action and engaging corporate actors.","Affiliations 1 Medical Research Council Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, SouthamptonSO16 6YD, UK. 2 National Institute for Health Research Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, University of Southampton and University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, SouthamptonSO16 6YD, UK. 3 Birmingham City University, BirminghamB5 5JU, UK. 4 Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London, LondonWC1E 6AU, UK.","Christina Vogel , Natasha Kriznik , Judith Stephenson , Mary Barker ",J Dev Orig Health Dis,2021 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Female,Humans,International Cooperation,Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena*,Nutritional Status / physiology*,Policy,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects / physiopathology,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects / prevention & control*,Reproductive Health / standards*,Social Justice / standards*,Societies, Medical / organization & administration",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32419689

290,The socialization of coping strategies in adolescence: the modeling role of parents,"Background and Objectives: The main aim of this study is to test the intergenerational transmission of the relations between coping strategies to well-being from parents to adolescents through the modeling of the coping strategies of the parents to those of the child.Methods: 154 cohabitating families composed by father, mother, and adolescent in age range between 14 and 18 (M = 16.40; SD = 1.53) took part to the research. To test the proposed model, SEM with observed variables and the integration of the APIM approach and the Bootstrapping approach was used.Results: Findings showed in both parents and adolescents significant positively relations between coping task strategy and well-being, and significant negatively relations between coping emotion strategy and well-being. Furthermore, direct positively relations between the use of specific coping strategies of father and mother and the use of the same strategies in adolescents was found. Finally, results showed the mediation of adolescents coping strategies in the relations between parental coping strategies and adolescents well-being.Conclusion: Taken as whole, our results demonstrated that coping strategies in parents were directly related to coping strategies in children and that both mothers and fathers contribute in unique ways to shape children's coping.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Messina, Italy. 2 Department of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy. 3 Department of Human, Social and Health Science, University of Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale, Cassino, Italy. 4 Department of Psychology, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Napoli, Italy.","Francesca Liga , Cristiano Inguglia , Maria Cristina Gugliandolo , Sonia Ingoglia , Sebastiano Costa ",Anxiety Stress Coping,2020 Jan,"Adaptation, Psychological*,Adolescent,Adolescent Behavior / psychology*,Adult,Aged,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Socialization*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31512507

292,Is growth restriction in twin pregnancies a double challenge? - A narrative review,"Background: Foetal growth restriction (FGR) complicates about 25-47% of twin pregnancies. One or both foetuses can be restricted. Pregnancies with discordant growth of foetuses are associated with a sevenfold increased risk of neonatal morbidity. Materials and methods: This is a narrative or traditional literature review. A literature search was performed to present a comprehensive, critical and objective analysis of the current knowledge on growth restriction in twin pregnancies. Results: The definitions of FGR in twin pregnancies and selective FGR (sFGR) differ between international societies. In 2019, the Delphi procedure aimed to unify the definitions of sFGR in twin pregnancies. Several growth charts for twins have been published. However, most societies recommend singleton growth charts as better in detecting hypoxic complications of FGR in twin pregnancies. Discordant growth in twins results from placental insufficiency, congenital anomalies, chromosomal aberrations and TORCH infections. Conclusions: Definitions and management of sFGR depend on chorionicity. The management aims to protect the properly growing foetus from ischemic complications or in utero death. In most cases, expectant management, strict surveillance and preterm labour are the methods of choice. Due to the co-existence of properly growing and small foetuses in one uterus, determining the appropriate time for delivery is challenging. In the case of preterm labour, even late preterm, antenatal corticosteroid therapy (ACT) in FGR twin pregnancies is beneficial because it decreases neonatal morbidity.","Affiliations 1 Department of Reproductive Health, Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland. 2 Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education, 1st Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, Warsaw, Poland.","Dagmara Filipecka-Tyczka , Grzegorz Jakiel , Anna Kajdy , Michał Rabijewski ",J Mother Child,2021 Jul 6,"Review,Female,Fetal Growth Retardation / epidemiology,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Placenta,Placental Insufficiency*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin*,Twins, Monozygotic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34233387

294,"[Textual research on ""Gui"" in Chinese classical prescriptions]","Through consulting the ancient herbs and medical books, combining with modern literature, this paper makes textual research on herbal medicine, and textual research on the name, origin, position and harvest and processing changes of the medicinal herbs in ancient classical prescriptions. According to research, Cinnamon medicinal materials were first listed in the Shennong's Herbal Classic, as the name of ""Jungui"" and ""Mugui"". Among them, Jungui has undergone the evolution of ""Qungui-Jungui-Tonggui-Jungui"". After the Northern and Southern Dynasties, a half-volume fatty ""Gui"" was added, but the usage of the three was no different. The names of Cinnamomi Ramulus and Cinnamomi Cortex did not appear until the Tang Dynasty, and they were preferably thick-skinned and with no cork cambium, and they were mostly used in the name of ""Guixin""; Since the Song and Yuan Dynasties, the medicinal parts of cassia have gradually separated. Cinnamomi Cortex is the trunk bark of sapling or branch bark, the twig is Cinnamomi Ramulus, and the tenderest twig is Liugui, Song Dynasty unified the name as ""Guizhi""; After the Ming and Qing Dynasties, Cinnamomi Cortex was used as the trunk bark, and Cinnamomi Ramulus was used as the tender twig; In modern times, the Chinese Pharmacopoeia stipulates that the Cinnamomi Ramulus is the young branch of C. cassia, which is Cinnamomum, and Cinnamomi Cortex was the dried trunk bark. From the plant morphology recorded in the previous herbals and the drawings, combined with the distribution of the origins described in the previous herbals, the mainstream plant used as a medicine in the past generations should be C. cassia, but there are other sect. Cinnamomum plants that are also used in medicine everywhere, such as C. chekiangensis, C. bejolghota, C. wilsonii, etc. Throughout the ages, different plant morphologies and medicinal traits have been used to distinguish different categories. The origins of the past dynasties are mostly present in Guangdong, Guangxi province and Vietnam, and are regarded as authentic. The methods for the harvest and processing of cinnamon medicinal materials are basically the same from ancient to modern times.","Affiliations 1 State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China. 2 State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Academician Workstation of Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004, China. 3 Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China. 4 Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China. 5 China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China.","Yi-Han Wang , Qian-Qian Weng , Jia-Chen Zhao , Yan Jin , Wei Zhang , Hua-Sheng Peng , Hai-Yu Xu , Hong-Jun Yang , Hua-Min Zhang , Zhi-Lai Zhan ",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,2020 Apr,"China,Drugs, Chinese Herbal*,Herbal Medicine,Medicine, Chinese Traditional,Phytotherapy,Plants, Medicinal*,Vietnam,Drugs, Chinese Herbal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32489053

Not much is known about the impact of a child's death on this crucial familial role. An integrative review of literature of 20 studies across psychology, nursing, communications, social work, and family sciences was undertaken to determine the current state of science regarding bereaved parenting. Results revealed three influential contexts: the general context of parental grief and bereavement, described as traumatic and life-changing experiences; the personal context of the resulting parental changes and coping strategies; and the relational context of the subsequent parenting of surviving children, an experience characterized by periodic conflict between personal and children's needs, emotional fluctuations, challenges with levels of protectiveness and control, and a heightened sense of responsibility within the parental role.

In 2 cases, on observing anticancer drug resistance, it was possible to regain control of cancer growth by coadministering herbal medicines. In the remaining 1 case, thrombocytopenia was observed during chemotherapy, which could be avoided by coadministering a herbal medicine.

Consequently, traditional Japanese (Kampo) herbal medicine is commonly used. Ryokeijutsukanto is used to treat dizziness caused by orthostatic dysregulation (OD). Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ryokeijutsukanto, a traditional Japanese (Kampo) herbal medicine, in treating dizziness, including light-headedness and/or palpitations. We focused on dizziness caused by OD, a condition commonly treated with ryokeijutsukanto. Design: We used a case series design. Setting: The study was centered in the department of internal medicine and department of otolaryngology at a general hospital. Patients: We tested ryokeijutsukanto in four female patients who were experiencing dizziness and who were diagnosed with OD. Intervention(s): The patients received ryokeijutsukanto (1.5 g to 4.2 g of dried extract daily). Main outcome measure(s): Ryokeijutsukanto was prescribed to the four patients; clinical efficacy and improvement in dizziness were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale and Vertigo Symptom Scale-Short Form. Results: All patients intended to continue Kampo treatment since high curative effects and no adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report elucidating the effectiveness of ryokeijutsukanto in treating dizziness as a result of OD. Ryokeijutsukanto may be an appropriate complementary therapy for OD.","Affiliations 1 Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1, Shikatacho, Kitaku, Okayamashi, Okayama 700-8558, Japan; Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Fukuyama Medical Center, 4-14-17, Okinogami-cho, Fukuyama, Hiroshima, 720-8520, Japan.

300,Efficacy of some Herbal Medicines in Osteoarthritis with a Focus on Topical Agents: A Systematic Review,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of musculoskeletal disorders that mainly affects the elderly population. Some herbal medicines have the potential to alleviate the pain associated with OA and improve physical activity mostly through anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of herbal medicines, especially topical types, on osteoarthritis. In this systematic review, the keywords ""osteoarthritis"", ""herbal compounds"", ""herbal medicine"", ""topical drug"", ""hydrogels"", ""cream"" and ""treatment"" were used to search publications published from 2010 to 2019 and indexed in databases including PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar. After screening of titles and abstracts and detection of duplicate publications, 38 eligible articles were included in the main review. We also included herbal formulations in vivo. Bioactive fractions of herbal medicines mostly worked on OA through suppression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), inducing nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation by inhibition of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and p65 nuclear translocation, downregulation of NF-κB targets including COX-2 and MMPs, upregulation of collagen type II, cartilage-specific proteoglycans (CSPGs), β1-integrin, and expression of cartilage-specific transcription factor SOX-9 protein. Noticeably, herbal medicines do not produce desirable effects, thereby using their combinations with other therapeutic agents seem to exert substantial clinical outcomes. Herbal gels have demonstrated robustly significant healing effects on knee pain, stiffness and mobility. It is worth considering that because OA is a chronic disease, longer duration of the studies/trials would even lead to obtaining more reliable judgments regarding topical treatment tolerability, safety and efficacy and clarify local or systemic adverse effects. Stability and standardization of a defined amount or concentrations of herbal gels would give promising effects on OA treatment and pain relief.","Affiliations 1 Student Research Committee, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran. 2 Clinical Research Development Unit, Kashani Hospital, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.","Sadra Ansaripour , Morteza Dehghan ",Curr Pharm Des,2020,"Systematic Review,Aged,Anti-Inflammatory Agents / therapeutic use,Chondrocytes* / metabolism,Humans,NF-kappa B / metabolism,Osteoarthritis* / drug therapy,Signal Transduction,Anti-Inflammatory Agents,NF-kappa B",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32348208

Whether participating in sports or physical activity on a recreational basis or striving to achieve a high level of athletic performance, individuals with type 1 diabetes must pay attention to their nutritional and dietary patterns, including intake of macronutrients, micronutrients, fluids and supplements, such as caffeine to maintain metabolic and glycemic balance. Performance aside, nutritional recommendations may also differ on an individual basis relative to exercise, glycemic management and body weight goals. Balancing all these dietary factors can be challenging for individuals with type 1 diabetes, and many related aspects have yet to be fully researched in this population.","Affiliation 1 Human Movement Sciences Department, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, United States.

It was scheduled to take place in Tampa, Florida, but had to be held virtually. The Dudrick Symposium honors the many pivotal and innovative contributions made by the late Dr Stanley J. Dudrick, physician scientist, academic leader, and a founding member of ASPEN. This year, in addition to honoring his legacy, we honored his life. As the 2019 recipient of the Dudrick Research Scholar Award, Dr Pimiento chaired the symposium. The presentations focused on discussing the history, the present and future frontiers in the overlapping fields of nutrition support and cancer care. The late Dr John Daly opened the presentation with a moving tribute to Dr Dudrick's life and then spoke about the impact of nutrition support on surgical care and outcomes for cancer patients. Dr Pimiento discussed the role of nutraceuticals for cancer chemoprevention, and the level 1 clinical evidence surrounding this topic. Dr Kraemer explored the role of exercise physiology for optimal nutrient utilization and the overlap between targeted physical activity and nutrition support to obtain better outcomes on the cancer population. The symposium was closed by Dr Stephen Hursting, who discussed the impact of obesity in the soaring cancer rates and its relationship with clinical outcomes.

307,Does Setting Goals Enhance Parenting Intervention Effects? A Field Experiment,"People who pursue approach goals (i.e., desired outcomes to be reached) tend to be more likely to achieve their goals than people who pursue avoidance goals (i.e., undesired outcomes to be prevented). We tested this premise in a brief preventive parenting intervention targeting parental praise to reduce disruptive child behavior. We also tested whether goal setting effects depend on behavior change phase (initiation versus maintenance) and parents' regulatory focus (high versus low promotion and prevention focus). Parents (N = 224; child age 4-8) were randomized to one of four conditions: an approach goal-enhanced or an avoidance goal-enhanced intervention condition, a no-goal intervention condition, or a waitlist control condition. Outcomes were parent-reported and audio-recorded positive parenting and disruptive child behavior. Results show that goal setting had very limited effects. Setting avoidance goals, not approach goals, improved self-reported positive parenting. However, goal setting did not enhance effects of parenting intervention on observed (i.e., audio-recorded) positive parenting and disruptive child behavior. Furthermore, goal setting effects depended neither on the phase of change, nor on parents' regulatory focus. This field experiment suggests that setting approach goals does not enhance the brief parenting intervention to improve parent-child interactions.",Affiliations 1 University of Amsterdam.

311,The parenting occupations and purposes conceptual framework: A scoping review of 'doing' parenting,"Introduction: Parenting is a valued, common and challenging adult role. Many parents, including some living with disability or difficult social circumstances, experience barriers to fulfilling their parenting roles. Yet, occupational therapy involvement in parenting is rarely documented. Current understandings about 'doing' parenting lack cohesion and are dispersed in occupational therapy literature. This study aims to map and synthesise occupational therapy literature on 'doing' parenting to describe the state of the existing knowledge base, and develop a conceptual framework of parenting occupations as portrayed in occupational therapy literature. Methods: A scoping review was conducted. Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched on 28 October 2019 and updated on 18 February 2021. Journal articles and book chapters were screened for eligibility. Included texts' publication characteristics, methodological characteristics, and areas of focus were summarised. Interpretive content analysis was conducted. Results: From 5945 unique records, 105 texts were included. These discussed general parenting, parents with disabilities, and parenting in challenging social situations. Most texts focussed on mothers caring for young children in Western cultural contexts. The analysis culminated in the development of a conceptual framework: the Parenting Occupations and Purposes (POP) Framework. This comprises 10 interrelated areas of parenting occupations, which are performed for the purposes of addressing the child's basic, developmental and social needs. Parenting occupations were also found to be influenced by additional, underlying occupations that build parenting capacity - Continuous Parental Development (CPD) occupations. Conclusion: These findings provide an overview of current occupational therapy conceptualisations of parenting. Unlike most of the existing literature on parenting, the POP Framework is parent-centric rather than child-centric. More research on parenting occupations is needed, especially with more diverse representation (fathers, ages of children, parental disability and sociocultural background). Further research is required to examine the POP Framework's usefulness in guiding research and practice, particularly among parents with diverse characteristics.","Affiliation 1 Discipline of Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.","Yu Zhuang Germaine Lim , Anne Honey , Margaret McGrath ",Aust Occup Ther J,2022 Feb,"Review,Adult,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Mothers,Occupational Therapy*,Occupations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959251
312,Napping in high-performance athletes: Sleepiness or sleepability?,"Daytime napping is a common practice in high-performance athletes, and is widely assumed to reflect sleepiness arising from sports-related sleep debt. The possibility that athlete naps may also be indicative of 'sleepability', a capacity to nap on demand that is only weakly related to homeostatic sleep pressure, has not previously been tested. The present study compared daytime sleep latencies in high-performance athletes and non-athlete controls using a single nap opportunity model. Elite (n = 10), and sub-elite (n = 10) athletes, and non-athlete controls (n = 10) attended the laboratory for a first adaption trial, and a subsequent experimental trial. Subjective sleepiness was assessed using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at 14:00, 14:30 and immediately prior to a 20-minute nap opportunity at 15:00. Sleep latencies were measured using polysomnography, and defined as the time from lights out to the first epoch of any stage of sleep (N1, N2, N3, REM). In unadjusted comparisons with non-athlete controls, elite athletes showed significantly shorter sleep latencies in both the adaptation (p < 0.05) and experimental trials (p < 0.05). These significant differences were maintained in models controlling for pre-trial KSS scores and pre-trial total sleep time (all p < 0.05). Sleep latency scores for sub-elite athletes showed similar trends, but were more labile. These results are consistent with a conclusion that, among elite athletes, napping behaviour can reflect sleepability and may not necessarily result from nocturnal sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness.","Affiliations 1 English Institute of Sport, The High Performance Centre, Bisham Abbey National Sports Centre, Buckinghamshire, UK. 2 Clinical Sleep Research Unit, School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, LE113TU, UK. 3 Gilchrist Performance, Reading, UK.","Luke Gupta , Kevin Morgan , Courtney North , Sarah Gilchrist ",Eur J Sport Sci,2021 Mar,"Analysis of Variance,Athletes*,Athletic Performance / physiology*,Female,Humans,Male,Polysomnography,Rest / physiology*,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Latency / physiology,Sleepiness*,Time Factors,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32174283

314,A Review of Authenticity and Authentication of Commercial Ginseng Herbal Medicines and Food Supplements,"Ginseng traditional medicines and food supplements are the globally top selling herbal products. Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolius and Panax notoginseng are the main commercial ginseng species in herbal medicine. Prices of ginseng products vary widely based on the species, quality, and purity of the used ginseng, and this provides a strong driver for intentional adulteration. Our systematic literature search has reviewed the authenticity results of 507 ginseng-containing commercial herbal products sold in 12 countries scattered across six continents. The analysis of the botanical and chemical identity of all these products shows that 76% are authentic while 24% were reported as adulterated. The number of commercial products as well as the percentage of adulteration varies significantly between continents, being highest in South America (100%) and Australia (75%), and lower in Europe (35%), North America (23%), Asia (21%) and Africa (0%). At a national level, from the five countries for which more than 10 products have been successfully authenticated, the highest percentage of adulterated ginseng products were purchased from Taiwan (49%), followed by Italy (37%), China (21%), and USA (12%), while all products bought in South Korea were reported to be authentic. In most cases, labeled Panax species were substituted with other Panax species, but substitution of ginseng root, the medicinally recommended plant part, with leaves, stems or flowers was also reported. Efficient and practical authentication using biomarkers to distinguish the main ginseng varieties and secondary metabolite spectra for age determination are essential to combat adulteration in the global marketplace.","Affiliations 1 ""Stejarul"" Research Centre for Biological Sciences, National Institute of Research and Development for Biological Sciences, Piatra Neamt, Romania. 2 Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.","Mihael Cristin Ichim , Hugo J de Boer ",Front Pharmacol,2021 Jan 11,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33505315

There is rarely any remarkable progress in the treatment of ICM from the available drugs. Recent research shows that natural herbal medicine may have beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The effective extracts of the herbs may improve myocardial ischemia through various actions, such as hemodynamic, hemorheological, and vascular actions, and on various cell biology aspects, such as intracellular calcium balance, mitochondria function, cell apoptosis, and scavenging free radicals.

316,"Relationship problems, agreement and bias in perceptions of partners' parental responsiveness, and family functioning","The current study examined whether couples' relationship problems negatively influenced perceptions of partners' parenting and, in turn, undermined family functioning. Couples (N = 96) completed assessments of relationship problems and family chaos before participating in a family play activity with their 4- to 5-year-old child. Parents reported on their own and their partner's responsiveness toward their child and how much the interaction was a positive and connected family experience. Objective observers also rated each parent's responsiveness toward their child. Parents completed measures assessing family chaos 1 year later. Perceptions of partners' parental responsiveness were significantly associated with both partners' self-reported and observers' ratings of partners' parental responsiveness, but such levels of relative agreement were modest. After accounting for agreement, perceptions of parental responsiveness was shaped by 2 sources of bias: (a) Parents who felt that they were less versus more responsive to their child viewed their partners as less versus more responsive as a parent (assumed similarity), and (b) parents who experienced greater relationship problems perceived their partner to be less responsive as a parent (relationship bias). Perceiving partners to be a less responsive parent, in turn, predicted (a) feeling less connected as a family during the interaction and residual increases in family chaos 1 year later. The results indicate that couples' relationship problems spill over to bias perceptions of parenting, which interferes with couples' ability to provide a connected, stable, and secure family environment. The results highlight that perceptual processes are important in understanding and addressing the ways couples' problems spill over across family subsystems.

318,Diet and nutrition in the management of inflammatory bowel disease,"The role of diet and its manipulation in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is gradually acquiring central stage. Certain dietary factors have been identified as putative triggers in IBD as some other factors are found to be protective. The dietary manipulation as part of comprehensive IBD care should be done by the clinician in conjunction with a skilled dietitian. Nutritional deficiencies are common in patients with IBD and can have long-term effects on disease course and quality of life in these patients. So, early identification and correction of these deficiencies along with proper nutritional supplementation should be addressed routinely as a part of IBD management. Oral nutritional supplementation is sufficient for most patients, but in some sick patients, tube feeding may be necessary. Diet needs to be individualized based on the nutritional deficiencies and dietary triggers in a specific patient. Multiple specific diets, with elimination of components that trigger inflammation or addition of components that alter gut microbes in a favorable way, are now appearing as a treatment option in IBD, but more evidence is required before their universal recommendation. Though enteral nutrition (EN) (both exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN] and partial enteral nutrition [PEN]) have proven therapeutic role in pediatric IBD, their uses and role are now expanding in adult IBD patients as well.","Affiliations 1 Department of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 110 029, India. 2 Institute of Gastroenterology, Pushpawati Singhania Hospital and Research Institute, Sheikh Sarai Phase 2, New Delhi, 110 017, India. drrakeshtandon@hotmail.com.","Pabitra Sahu , Saurabh Kedia , Vineet Ahuja , Rakesh K Tandon ",Indian J Gastroenterol,2021 Jun,"Review,Child,Diet,Enteral Nutrition,Humans,Inflammatory Bowel Diseases* / therapy,Nutritional Status,Quality of Life*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34037954
319,"The therapeutic properties of ketogenic diets, slow-wave sleep, and circadian synchrony","Purpose of review: To summarize emerging connections between sleep, ketogenic diets, and health. Recent findings: Mechanisms involved in the therapeutic benefits of ketogenic diets continue to be elucidated. Concurrently, the importance of sleep quality and circadian rhythms in their effects on metabolic and cognitive health is increasingly appreciated. Advances in the understanding of the actions of adenosine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and slow-wave sleep underscore connections between these areas of research. Summary: Many molecular pathways activated during ketogenic diets are known to modulate sleep-wake cycles, circadian rhythms, and sleep stages. Ketogenic diets often have beneficial effects on sleep at the same time as having beneficial effects on particular medical conditions. Enhancement of slow-wave sleep and rejuvenation of circadian programming may be synergistic with or causally involved in the benefits of ketogenic diets.","Affiliation 1 Independent researcher, Boulder, Colorado, USA.",L Amber O'Hearn ,Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes,2021 Oct 1,"Review,Circadian Rhythm,Diet, Ketogenic*,Humans,Sleep,Sleep, Slow-Wave*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34269711
320,Internal coherence matters: Lessons for nutrition and dietetics research,"Aim: Internal coherence in research refers to the alignment between ontology (nature of reality), epistemology (nature of knowledge), axiology (values), methodology and methods and is an important but often overlooked element of research quality. We therefore aimed to illustrate the concept of internal coherence in nutrition and dietetics research, and its importance beyond individual elements of study quality. Method: A targeted literature search in Nutrition and Dietetics was used to identify research illustrating one example of three main approaches to research (scientific, interpretive and critical inquiry) published between November 2017 and November 2020. Studies were included if they related to education research based on the expertise of the authors, and illustrated diverse points about internal coherence. The authors independently critiqued included studies for internal coherence and synthesised their findings. Results: From 76 manuscripts, 14 were identified as describing education research. Of the three selected studies that were critiqued, all had elements of internal coherence, in particular alignment between epistemology and methodology. However, each had elements of misalignment too, specifically between epistemology, axiology and method. The results point to the profession's historical groundings privileging the scientific approach, showing how this can yield misalignments, particularly when describing the limitations of interpretive and critical inquiry approaches. Conclusion: This review demonstrates the importance of internal coherence as a marker of quality, over and above existing quality assessment checklists for qualitative and quantitative methodologies. As such, it can help authors, reviewers and editors to improve the quality of nutrition and dietetics research and its reporting.","Affiliations 1 Monash Centre for Scholarship in Health Education (MCSHE), Faculty of Medicine, Nursing & Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia. 2 Department of Nutrition, Dietetics and Food, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing & Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia. 3 Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, Bond University, Robina, Queensland, Australia.","Claire Palermo , Dianne P Reidlinger , Charlotte E Rees ",Nutr Diet,2021 Jul,"Review,Dietetics*,Humans,Nutritional Status,Research Design",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34151511

323,Automated scoring of pre-REM sleep in mice with deep learning,"Reliable automation of the labor-intensive manual task of scoring animal sleep can facilitate the analysis of long-term sleep studies. In recent years, deep-learning-based systems, which learn optimal features from the data, increased scoring accuracies for the classical sleep stages of Wake, REM, and Non-REM. Meanwhile, it has been recognized that the statistics of transitional stages such as pre-REM, found between Non-REM and REM, may hold additional insight into the physiology of sleep and are now under vivid investigation. We propose a classification system based on a simple neural network architecture that scores the classical stages as well as pre-REM sleep in mice. When restricted to the classical stages, the optimized network showed state-of-the-art classification performance with an out-of-sample F1 score of 0.95 in male C57BL/6J mice. When unrestricted, the network showed lower F1 scores on pre-REM (0.5) compared to the classical stages. The result is comparable to previous attempts to score transitional stages in other species such as transition sleep in rats or N1 sleep in humans. Nevertheless, we observed that the sequence of predictions including pre-REM typically transitioned from Non-REM to REM reflecting sleep dynamics observed by human scorers. Our findings provide further evidence for the difficulty of scoring transitional sleep stages, likely because such stages of sleep are under-represented in typical data sets or show large inter-scorer variability. We further provide our source code and an online platform to run predictions with our trained network.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medical Engineering and Technomathematics, FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Jülich, 52428, Germany. 2 Independent researcher, Kottbusser Damm 35, Berlin, 10967, Germany. 3 Department of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, 72076, Germany. 4 Department of Medical Engineering and Technomathematics, FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Jülich, 52428, Germany. bialonski@fh-aachen.de.","Niklas Grieger , Justus T C Schwabedal , Stefanie Wendel , Yvonne Ritze , Stephan Bialonski ",Sci Rep,2021 Jun 10,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Algorithms,Animals,Deep Learning*,Mice,Models, Theoretical*,Polysomnography,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Stages*,Sleep, REM*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34112829
324,"Self-Reported Sleep Need, Subjective Resilience, and Cognitive Performance Following Sleep Loss and Recovery Sleep","Objective: Individuals vary in response to sleep loss: some individuals are ""vulnerable"" and demonstrate cognitive decrements following insufficient sleep, while others are ""resistant"" and maintain baseline cognitive capability. Physiological markers (e.g., genetic polymorphisms) have been identified that can predict relative vulnerability. However, a quick, cost-effective, and feasible subjective predictor tool has not been developed. The objective of the present study was to determine whether two factors-""subjective sleep need"" and ""subjective resilience""-predict cognitive performance following sleep deprivation. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy, sleep-satiated young adults participated. These individuals were screened for sleep disorders, comorbidities, and erratic sleep schedules. Prior to 40 hours of in-laboratory total sleep deprivation, participants were questioned on their subjective sleep need and completed a validated resilience scale. During and after sleep deprivation, participants completed a 5-minute psychomotor vigilance test every 2 hours. Results: Both subjective resilience and subjective sleep need individually failed to predict performance during sleep loss. However, these two measures interacted to predict performance. Individuals with low resilience and low sleep need had poorer cognitive performance during sleep loss. However, in individuals with medium or high resilience, psychomotor vigilance test performance was not predicted by subjective sleep need. Higher resilience may be protective against sleep loss-related neurobehavioral impairments in the context of subjective sleep need. Conclusions: Following sleep loss (and recovery sleep), trait resilient individuals may outperform those with lower resiliency on real-world tasks that require continuous attention. Future studies should determine whether the present findings generalize to other, operationally relevant tasks and additional cognitive domains.","Affiliation 1 Behavioral Biology Branch, 8394Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA.","Janna Mantua , Allison J Brager , Sara E Alger , Folarin Adewale , Lillian Skeiky , Thomas J Balkin , Vincent F Capaldi , Guido Simonelli ",Psychol Rep,2021 Feb,"Adaptation, Psychological*,Adolescent,Adult,Cognition / physiology*,Female,Humans,Male,Psychomotor Performance,Self Report,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Deprivation / physiopathology,Sleep Deprivation / psychology*,Wakefulness,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32000581
325,Securinine suppresses osteoclastogenesis and ameliorates inflammatory bone loss,"Securinine (Sec) is a naturally derived compound separated from the roots of Securinega suffruticosa, which has long been used as a herbal medicine. Sec is widely known as a GABA receptor antagonist, it is also known as an innate immune cell agonist and has been reported to increase macrophage activity and promote monocyte maturation. On the basis of these studies, we investigated the effect of Sec on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorbing function. We have found that Sec inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, fusion, actin ring formation, and bone resorbing function by the inhibition of gene expression associated with each stage. Moreover, Sec significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis by decreasing the phosphorylation of p38, Akt, JNK, IκB, and PLCγ2, in pathways involved in early osteoclastogenesis as well as through the subsequent suppression of c-Fos and NFATc1. Finally, Sec effectively protected bone loss induced by the excessive inflammatory responses and activity of osteoclasts in vivo by a micro-CT and histological analysis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Sec may be a promising drug for bone metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis, which is associated with the excessive activity of osteoclasts.","Affiliations 1 Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Republic of Korea. 2 Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wonkwang University Hospital, Iksan, Republic of Korea. 3 Core Research Facility Center, School of Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Republic of Korea. 4 Musculoskeletal and Immune Disease Research Institute, School of Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Republic of Korea. 5 Department of Radiology, Wonkwang University Hospital, Iksan, Republic of Korea. 6 Medical Convergence Research Center, Wonkwang University Hospital, Iksan, Republic of Korea.","Sung Chul Kwak , Da Hye Jeong , Yoon-Hee Cheon , Chang Hoon Lee , Kwon-Ha Yoon , Ju-Young Kim , Myeung Su Lee ",Phytother Res,2020 Nov,"Animals,Azepines / pharmacology,Azepines / therapeutic use*,Bone Diseases, Metabolic / drug therapy*,Bone Diseases, Metabolic / pathology,Cell Differentiation,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring / pharmacology,Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring / therapeutic use*,Humans,Lactones / pharmacology,Lactones / therapeutic use*,Mice,Osteogenesis / drug effects*,Piperidines / pharmacology,Piperidines / therapeutic use*,Azepines,Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring,Lactones,Piperidines,securinine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510717

327,Sleeping through the night or through the nights?,"Objective: There are substantial inter-individual differences in infants' longest consecutive sleep duration. However, intra-individual differences are rarely considered. The present study aimed to describe night-to-night variability in achieving 6 or 8 h of consolidated sleep over a 13-night period in 6-month-old infants. Methods: Forty-four typically developing infants were part of the study (22 girls). When infants were 6 months old, mothers were asked to complete an infant sleep diary over 13 nights to measure the longest period of uninterrupted sleep each night. Two criteria were used to determine if infants were sleeping through the night: 6 and 8 h of uninterrupted sleep. Results: On average, mothers reported that their infant slept 6 h consecutively for about 5 nights out of 13. Nine infants (20.5%) never slept 6 h consecutively, three (6.8%) met the criterion every night, but most infants (n = 32; 72.7%) showed high variability between the nights. Mothers reported that their infant slept 8 h consecutively for about 3 nights out of 13. Half of the infants (50.0%) never slept 8 h consecutively, one infant (2.3%) slept 8 h consecutively every night, and twenty-one infants (47.7%) showed high variability. Conclusions: These findings expand current knowledge by showing that there is not only high inter-individual variability, but also high intra-individual variability in infant sleep consolidation. Parents and clinicians should be aware that occasional sleeping through the night does not necessarily indicate a consolidation of this behavior.","Affiliations 1 Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; Hôpital en santé mentale Rivière-des-Prairies (CIUSSS-NIM), Montreal, QC, Canada.

329,Validity of the Finnish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA),"The aim of the present study was to validate the Finnish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA) using data from 1,688 Finnish parents (91% mothers) living in Finland with at least one child living at home. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the theoretical four-factor structure of the PBA - emotional exhaustion in one's parental role, contrast with previous parental self, feelings of being fed up with one's parental role, and emotional distancing from one's children. Internal consistency for the total scale was excellent (Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.90) and for the subscales from acceptable (alpha ≥ 0.70) to excellent. The results further demonstrated strict factorial invariance of PBA across genders and educational status groups. Finally, the PBA and its four subscales correlated as expected with the three criteria variables (depressive symptoms, sleep disruptions, and self-esteem), the latent factors of all three criteria variables being still clearly unique and separate constructions from parental burnout factors.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland. 2 Methodology Centre for Human Sciences, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland.","Kaisa Aunola , Matilda Sorkkila , Asko Tolvanen ",Scand J Psychol,2020 Oct,"Adult,Burnout, Psychological* / diagnosis,Burnout, Psychological* / psychology,Emotions,Female,Finland,Humans,Male,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Psychometrics / methods*,Reproducibility of Results,Self Concept,Surveys and Questionnaires,Translations",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32542689
330,Carbohydrates in nutrition: friend or foe?,"Fats, proteins and carbohydrates are the main energy supplies in human nutrition. The ratio of these three has often been discussed within the nutritional sciences over the years. Carbohydrates were important for our ancestors since many carbohydrate-rich foods were easily storable without cooling in comparison to protein-rich or fat-rich food, such as meat or fish. While humans consumed a mostly low-calorie nutrition and experienced seasonal changes in food availability and abundance for a long time, food supply changed in the last 100 years. We are now living in abundance, leading to a drastic increase in man-made and chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus. High, unregulated blood sugar levels in combination with the accumulation of advanced glycation end products seem to be major causes for the development of diabetes. Therefore, it is under discussion how healthy carbohydrates are and if they have to be avoided in nutrition.","Affiliations 1 Klinik für Herzchirurgie, Universitätsklinikum Halle (Saale), Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Ernst-Grube Str. 40, 06120, Halle (Saale), Germany. 2 Klinik für Herzchirurgie, Universitätsklinikum Halle (Saale), Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Ernst-Grube Str. 40, 06120, Halle (Saale), Germany. andreas.simm@uk-halle.de.","Anne Großkopf , Andreas Simm ",Z Gerontol Geriatr,2020 Jul,"Review,Diet*,Dietary Carbohydrates*,Dietary Fats,Energy Intake*,Humans,Nutritional Status,Dietary Carbohydrates,Dietary Fats",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333094

However, this becomes more difficult during preadolescence as children seek greater autonomy away from the direct supervision of adults. The current study focused on preadolescent youth (10-13 years) and examined parent-child disagreements about safety, with a focus on determining if child temperament attributes moderate the relation between how parents learn of these and resolve these disagreements. Methods: A short-term longitudinal design was used. Parents and children retrospectively recalled safety disagreements together and then independently completed questionnaires about these. Parents then tracked disagreements over 1 month. Results: The behavioral attributes of inhibitory control and risk-taking propensity both moderated the relationships between parental source of knowledge of safety disagreements and subsequent methods of resolution. Conclusion: Safety-promotion messaging for parents of preadolescents may need to be tailored based on child attributes to maximize effectiveness.","Affiliation 1 Psychology Department, University of Guelph.","Alexa Kane , Barbara A Morrongiello ",J Pediatr Psychol,2020 Mar 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Child,Family Conflict / psychology*,Female,Humans,Male,Negotiating / psychology*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Pregnancy,Retrospective Studies,Safety*,Surveys and Questionnaires,Temperament*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32027375

We examined moderation by parent gender, education, family income, and coparenting conflict. We found large deteriorations from before the pandemic to the first months of the pandemic in child internalizing and externalizing problems and parent depression, and a moderate decline in coparenting quality. Smaller changes were found for parent anxiety and parenting quality. Mothers and families with lower levels of income were at particular risk for deterioration in well-being.

Methods: The present descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 300 pregnant women referred to Kashan health center to receive prenatal care services in 2020. The study participants were randomly selected using stratified random sampling with proportional allocation. The data collection tool was a two-part researcher made questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire included demographic information, midwifery information, and questions related to women's awareness about herbal medicine. The second part of the questionnaire was designed based on the theory of planned behavior including attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, intention, and behavior performance. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and SPSS version 18.0. Results: The mean age of participants was 28. 7±5.4 years (range, 15-45 years), the majority were housewives (88.3%) and had secondary education (39.3%). A total of 164 women (57. 1%) used medicinal herbs during pregnancy. The individual's attitude towards herbal medicines consumption, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control was correlated with behavioral intention (P < 0.05). Similarly, subjective norms were the most predictor of using herbal medicine among pregnant women (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The findings revealed that more than 50 % of pregnant women used medicinal herbs during pregnancy. The present study showed that the individual's attitude towards herbal medicines consumption, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control was correlated with intention of herbal medicine use among pregnant women. Likewise, subjective norms were the most predictor of herbal medicine use among pregnant women. The TPB should be addressed in planning health education programs and modifying health behaviors, including self-medication, especially during pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of midwifery, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran. 2 Trauma Nursing Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran. sadat_z2003@yahoo.com. 3 Ms.c of midwifery counseling, Student Research Committee, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 4 Department of midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran. 5 Department of Health Education and Promotion, Public Health School, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. 6 Trauma Nursing Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.","Zahra Karimian , Zohreh Sadat , Bahareh Afshar , Maryam Hasani , Marzieh Araban , Mahbubeh Kafaei-Atrian ",BMC Complement Med Ther,2021 Aug 17,"Adolescent,Adult,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Forecasting,Health Behavior,Herbal Medicine*,Humans,Iran,Middle Aged,Pregnancy,Psychological Theory*,Self Medication / psychology*,Self Medication / trends*,Surveys and Questionnaires,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34404404
334,Effect of Inadequate Sleep on Frequent Mental Distress,"Introduction: One-third of US adults report sleeping less than the recommended amount, and approximately 20% live with a mental illness. The objective of our study was to examine the association between inadequate sleep and frequent mental distress in a population-based sample of US adults. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study by using 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data that included 273,695 US adults aged 18 to 64. Inadequate sleep was defined as 6 hours or less in a given night, and frequent mental distress was defined as self-reporting 14 days of mental health status as ""not good"" within the last month. We used weighted logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Results: Thirteen percent of study participants experienced inadequate sleep, and 14.1% experienced frequent mental distress. Participants who averaged 6 hours or less of sleep per night were about 2.5 times more likely to have frequent mental distress when controlling for confounders (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 2.32-2.73) than those who slept more than 6 hours. Conclusion: Inadequate sleep was associated with significantly increased odds of frequent mental distress. Our findings suggest that further research is necessary to evaluate the temporal relationship between inadequate sleep and frequent mental distress.","Affiliations 1 University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina. 2 UNC Charlotte, Department of Public Health Sciences, Charlotte, NC 28223.

335,Effects of propofol on sleep architecture and sleep-wake systems in rats,"Previous studies have shown that the synchronization of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is found during propofol-induced general anesthesia, which is similar to that of slow-wave sleep (SWS). However, a complete understanding is lacking in terms of the characteristics of EEG changes in rats after propofol administration and whether propofol acts through natural sleep circuits. Here, we examined the characteristics of EEG patterns induced by intraperitoneal injection of propofol in rats. We found that high (10 mg/kg) and medium (5 mg/kg) doses of propofol induced a cortical EEG of low-frequency, high-amplitude activity with rare electromyographic activity and markedly shortened sleep latency. The high dose of propofol increased deep slow-wave sleep (SWS2) to 4 h, as well as the number of large SWS2 bouts (>480 s), their mean duration and the peak of the power density curve in the delta range of 0.75-3.25 Hz. After the medium dose of propofol, the total number of wakefulness, light slow-wave sleep (SWS1) and SWS2 episodes increased, whereas the mean duration of wakefulness decreased. The high dose of propofol significantly increased c-fos expression in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) sleep center and decreased the number of c-fos-immunoreactive neurons in wake-related systems including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), perifornical nucleus (PeF), lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LH), ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vPAG) and supramammillary region (SuM). These results indicated that the high dose of propofol produced high-quality sleep by increasing SWS2, whereas the medium dose produced fragmented and low-quality sleep by disrupting the continuity of wakefulness. Furthermore, sleep-promoting effects of propofol are correlated with activation of the VLPO cluster and inhibition of the TMN, PeF, LH, vPAG and SuM.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Affiliated Sixth People' s Hospital, NO. 222, Huanhuxisan Road, Shanghai, 201306, PR China. 2 Department of Anesthesiology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Affiliated Sixth People' s Hospital, NO. 222, Huanhuxisan Road, Shanghai, 201306, PR China. 3 Department of Neuroscience, Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology, Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, PR China.

336,An Exploratory Study of Autism Traits and Parenting,"The study examined the association between autism traits and parenting when raising a typically developing (TD) child, and differences in parenting needs between parents with high and low traits. Fifty-eight parents with a blood relative with Autism (who happened to be an offspring with ASD in all cases) and a TD child completed the Autism Quotient, demographic and psychological information, as well as reporting on Parenting Sense of Competence, the Parent-Child Relationship, and Parenting Needs. Autism traits did not uniquely contribute to parenting self-esteem, but were associated with parenting difficulties for their TD child, and some aspects of this parent-child relationship. Parents with high autism traits reported more parenting difficulties than parents with low traits. The study identified specific aspects of parenting needing support to assist parents with high autism traits prosper in their parenting role.","Affiliations 1 Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, School of Psychology & Public Health, La Trobe University, 1 Kingsbury Drive, Bundoora, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia. c.dissanayake@latrobe.edu.au. 2 Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, School of Psychology & Public Health, La Trobe University, 1 Kingsbury Drive, Bundoora, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia.","Cheryl Dissanayake , Amanda Richdale , Natasha Kolivas , Lindsay Pamment ",J Autism Dev Disord,2020 Jul,"Adolescent,Adult,Autistic Disorder / diagnosis*,Autistic Disorder / psychology*,Child,Child of Impaired Parents / psychology*,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Self Concept",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30877419
337,Apical drive-A cellular mechanism of dreaming?,"Dreams are internally generated experiences that occur independently of current sensory input. Here we argue, based on cortical anatomy and function, that dream experiences are tightly related to the workings of a specific part of cortical pyramidal neurons, the apical integration zone (AIZ). The AIZ receives and processes contextual information from diverse sources and could constitute a major switch point for transitioning from externally to internally generated experiences such as dreams. We propose that during dreams the output of certain pyramidal neurons is mainly driven by input into the AIZ. We call this mode of functioning ""apical drive"". Our hypothesis is based on the evidence that the cholinergic and adrenergic arousal systems, which show different dynamics between waking, slow wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep, have specific effects on the AIZ. We suggest that apical drive may also contribute to waking experiences, such as mental imagery. Future studies, investigating the different modes of apical function and their regulation during sleep and wakefulness are likely to be richly rewarded.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Estonia; Institute of Biology, Humboldt University Berlin, Germany.

Recently published data on the benefits of parenteral nutrition versus enteral nutrition together with the widespread use of indirect calorimetry solve many safety issues that have emerged over the years. All these advances, alongside a better understanding of glycemic control and lipid and protein formulation improvements, make parenteral nutrition a safe alternative to enteral nutrition.","Affiliation 1 Department of General Intensive Care, Institute for Nutrition Research, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petah Tikva 49100, Israel.","Moran Hellerman Itzhaki , Pierre Singer ",Nutrients,2020 Mar 8,"Review,Calorimetry, Indirect / trends,Enteral Nutrition / trends,Food, Formulated,Humans,Nutritional Sciences / trends*,Parenteral Nutrition / trends*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32182654
339,Sex- and Age-dependent Differences in Sleep-wake Characteristics of Fisher-344 Rats,"Aging is a well-recognized risk factor for sleep disruption. The characteristics of sleep in aging include its disruption by frequent awakenings, a decline in both non-rapid eye movement (nonREM) and REM sleep amounts, and a weaker homeostatic response to sleep loss. Evidence also suggests that sleep in females is more sensitive to changes in the ovarian steroidal milieu. The Fischer-344 rats are commonly used experimental subjects in behavioral and physiological studies, including sleep and aging. Most sleep studies in Fischer-344 rats have used male subjects to avoid interactions between the estrus and sleep-waking cycles. The changes in the sleep-wake organization of female Fischer-344 rats, especially with advancing age, are not well-characterized. We determined sleep-waking features of cycling females across estrus stages. We also compared spontaneous and homeostatic sleep response profiles of young (3-4 months) and old (24-25 months) male and female Fischer-344 rats. The results suggest that: i) sleep-wake architectures across stages of estrus cycle in young females were largely comparable except for a significant suppression of REM sleep at proestrus night and an increase in REM sleep the following day; ii) despite hormonal differences, sleep-wake architecture in male and female rats of corresponding ages were comparable except for the suppression of REM sleep at proestrus night and higher nonREM delta power in recovery sleep; and iii) aging significantly affected sleep-wake amounts, sleep-wake stability, and homeostatic response to sleep loss in both male and female rats and that the adverse effects of aging were largely comparable in both sexes.","Affiliations 1 Research Service (151A3), Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Sepulveda, CA, USA. 2 Research Service (151A3), Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Sepulveda, CA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. 3 Research Service (151A3), Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Sepulveda, CA, USA; Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. 4 Research Service (151A3), Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Sepulveda, CA, USA; Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

340,Cortical excitability signatures for the degree of sleepiness in human,"Sleep is essential in maintaining physiological homeostasis in the brain. While the underlying mechanism is not fully understood, a 'synaptic homeostasis' theory has been proposed that synapses continue to strengthen during awake and undergo downscaling during sleep. This theory predicts that brain excitability increases with sleepiness. Here, we collected transcranial magnetic stimulation measurements in 38 subjects in a 34 hr program and decoded the relationship between cortical excitability and self-report sleepiness using advanced statistical methods. By utilizing a combination of partial least squares regression and mixed-effect models, we identified a robust pattern of excitability changes, which can quantitatively predict the degree of sleepiness. Moreover, we found that synaptic strengthen occurred in both excitatory and inhibitory connections after sleep deprivation. In sum, our study provides supportive evidence for the synaptic homeostasis theory in human sleep and clarifies the process of synaptic strength modulation during sleepiness.","Affiliations 1 Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. 2 Institute of Neuroscience, State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. 3 Shanghai Center for Brain Science and Brain-Inspired Intelligence Technology, Shanghai, China. 4 Institute of Brain Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. 5 Shanghai Key Laboratory of Psychotic Disorders, Shanghai Mental HealthCenter, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. 6 Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China. 7 Translational Research Institute of Brain and Brain-Like Intelligence, Shanghai Fourth People's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.","Chin-Hsuan Chia # , Xin-Wei Tang # , Yue Cao # , Hua-Teng Cao , Wei Zhang , Jun-Fa Wu , Yu-Lian Zhu , Ying Chen , Yi Lin , Yi Wu , Zhe Zhang , Ti-Fei Yuan , Rui-Ping Hu ",Elife,2021 Jul 27,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Brain / physiology*,Cortical Excitability / physiology*,Electroencephalography*,Female,Healthy Volunteers,Humans,Male,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Deprivation,Sleepiness,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34313218

It is an important risk factor for major diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. Presently, there is no definite and effective anti-aging treatment. Chinese herbal medicine has a long history of application and is often used for aging-related diseases in China. A large number of clinical and preclinical studies on the anti-aging effect of Chinese herbal medicine has been performed. Through literature research, we reviewed the anti-aging clinical research of Chinese herbal medicine and preclinical research of Chinese herbal medicine monomers, components, extracts, and compounds, and their mechanisms. Results from preclinical studies have shown that Chinese herbal medicines have beneficial anti-aging effects. The mechanism mainly includes anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotection, apoptosis and mitochondrial function regulation, etc. However, more detailed high-quality clinical trials are required for future investigation of the anti-aging effects of Chinese herbal medicines.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China. 2 Cardiovascular Diseases Center, Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China. 3 Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China. 4 School of Chinese Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, China. 5 School of Chinese Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong, China. linzx@cuhk.edu.hk. 6 Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100091, China. dr.xufengqin@outlook.com.","Junnan Zhao , Xu Lan , Yue Liu , Yanfei Liu , Yanfang Xian , Zhixiu Lin , Fengqin Xu ",Ann Palliat Med,2020 May,"Review,Aging*,Apoptosis,China,Drugs, Chinese Herbal* / therapeutic use,Humans,Drugs, Chinese Herbal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32389009

Participants included 561 children adopted at birth, and their adoptive parents and birth parents within a prospective longitudinal adoption study. Findings indicated child effects on parental negativity, such that toddlers' negative reactivity at 18 months was positively associated with adoptive parents' over-reactive and hostile parenting at 27 months. Furthermore, we found that child effects on parental negativity were partially due to heritable (e.g., birth mother [BM] internalizing problems and substance use) and prenatal factors (e.g., BM illicit drug use during pregnancy) that influence children's negative reactivity at 18 months.

344,Impact of Nutrition on the Next Generation: The INCAP Longitudinal Study,"Background: The design of the original nutrition supplementation trial that was conducted from 1969 to 1977 in 4 villages in rural Guatemala to evaluate the benefits of improving nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood, combined with several follow-up studies, provides unique data to examine the effects of improving nutrition on the next generation. Objective: This article provides a summary of the key findings from the INCAP Longitudinal Study on the intergenerational effects of improving nutrition on the growth and well-being of the next generation. Methods: The key outcomes include offspring birth size as well as attained size and body composition through age 11 years. The sample sizes varied from approximately 200 to 800 depending on the timing of the follow-up studies and data collection protocols. The effects of parental birth size, maternal linear growth from birth through adulthood, and exposure to the nutrition intervention, that is, Atole versus Fresco during critical periods from prenatal through age 15 years, have been examined using complex models and approaches. Results: Overall, these publications demonstrate clear improvements in the growth of the next generation. Effects were seen primarily for maternal exposure to Atole and were larger for boys compared to girls. Stunting during early childhood among girls was also a significant predictor of offspring birth size, and younger age at first pregnancy (<20 years) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in the offspring. Conclusions: These studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of the importance of investing in nutrition, especially during early childhood for future generations.","Affiliation 1 Hubert Department of Global Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.",Usha Ramakrishnan ,Food Nutr Bull,2020 Jun,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Adolescent,Child,Child Nutrition Sciences,Child, Preschool,Cohort Effect*,Dietary Supplements*,Family Characteristics,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Guatemala,Human Development / physiology*,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Nutritional Physiological Phenomena*,Nutritional Status*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33172290

346,Exploring Sports Nutrition Knowledge in Elite Gaelic Footballers,"Nutrition intake plays a crucial role in improving athletic performance, enhancing adaptations to training, and augmenting recovery from exercise. However, research has reported that Gaelic footballers consistently fail to meet energy and carbohydrate recommendations. Sports nutrition knowledge (SNK) can influence the dietary intake of athletes, and therefore has the potential to have a significant impact on athletic performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the current level of SNK in elite Gaelic footballers (n = 100). An online version of the Nutrition for Sport Knowledge Questionnaire (NSKQ) was used to assess sports SNK. The overall mean SNK scores for Gaelic footballers and practitioners were 47.6 ± 12.3% and 78.1 ± 8.3%, respectively. There were no differences in knowledge between age groups, education level or divisional status. The top three sources of nutrition information identified by participants were team dietitian/nutritionists (84.0%), athletic trainers/strength and conditioning coaches (73%), and social media (37%). The results show that there is a major gap in the SNK of Gaelic footballers, while practitioners demonstrated a promising SNK, that could support Gaelic footballers. There is a need for development of interventions and knowledge transfer partnerships, including more effective methods of educating Gaelic footballers and translating sports nutrition principles to players. Developing appropriate nutritional education strategies using online resources and mobile applications could help to improve nutritional knowledge and practice of Gaelic footballers.","Affiliations 1 School of Health Sciences, Liverpool Hope University, Hope Park, Liverpool L16 9JD, UK. 2 Gaelic Sports Research Centre, Technological University Dublin, Tallaght, D24 FKT9 Dublin, Ireland.","Luke O'Brien , Kieran Collins , Farzad Amirabdollhian ",Nutrients,2021 Mar 26,"Athletic Performance,Cross-Sectional Studies,Health Education,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Humans,Male,Sports Nutritional Sciences / education*,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33810237

This randomized, placebo-controlled, preliminary study evaluated SDT for cancer-related fatigue, which is the most common symptom experienced by patients with cancer. Patients and methods: Patients with a Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) score of at least 4 were randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner to receive SDT (3 g 3 times daily) or placebo orally for 3 weeks. The BFI was the primary outcome measure and secondary outcome measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), immunoregulatory tests, and safety. Results: A total of 50 participants were randomly assigned and 48 patients completed the trial. Based on intention-to-treat analysis, fatigue, which was the primary outcome, was improved in both arms compared with the baseline, and was significantly better in the SDT group than in the placebo group at week 3 (3.56 ± 1.18 vs 4.63 ± 1.83, P = .019). Secondary outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and immunoregulatory tests, did not improve significantly in either group. However, quality of life measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 improved in both arms compared with the baseline, and the global health subscale was significantly better in the SDT group than in the placebo group (P = .02). No significant toxicities were observed. Conclusion: SDT may improve cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in patients with cancer.

This study examined how parental worry and family-based disaster education related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Method: Parents reported parental worry, family-based disaster education and their children's (5-8-year-old young elementary schoolchildren [n = 245] and 245 9-13-year-old early adolescents [n = 245]) internalizing and externalizing problems. Results: Data analysis showed that (a) across ages, parental worry related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems significantly and positively; (b) the significant and negative relationships between family-based disaster education and internalizing and externalizing problems were only supported in young elementary schoolchildren; and (c) high level of parent worry attenuated the negative link between family-based disaster education and young elementary schoolchildren's internalizing problems. Conclusion: This study expands our knowledge about relationships between parental worry and children's disaster-related well-being, and highlights the importance of adapting family-based disaster education to different ages. Data suggest that parents of young elementary schoolchildren and early adolescents both should avoid showing excessive worry in front of their children during the pandemic to help reduce their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Effective family-based disaster education can mitigate young elementary schoolchildren's emotional distress and behavioral problems, the effect of which may be maximized if parents can avoid being overly worried. Parents of early adolescents should support their children in acquiring pandemic-related information independently and encourage them to seek support outside the family.

350,The effects of co-parenting/intergenerational co-parenting interventions during the postpartum period: A systematic review,"Background: Co-parenting interventions have been offered, particularly to enhance paternal involvement in infant care. However, little is known about whether such co-parenting interventions can be effective in improving the psychological health of families and co-parenting outcomes during the postpartum period. Objectives: The aim of this review was to examine the effects of interventions on the co-parenting relationship of families, the psychological health of members involved, and on co-parenting outcomes during the postpartum period. Methods: This was a systematic review with a meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials of co-parenting intervention studies were selected following the standardized methods recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 6. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. Results: Twelve co-parenting randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Most studies reported positive effects in promoting at least one domain of co-parenting in mothers and/or fathers, especially in co-parenting support, couple communication, parent-child interactions and reducing co-parenting undermining. Meta-analysis showed that mothers in the intervention group showed significantly lower depressive symptoms compared to those in the control group. The only online co-parenting intervention identified produced similar effects to that of face-to-face interventions on improving co-parenting support, and reducing co-parenting undermining. Only one study focused on parent-grandparent co-parenting, which reported positive effects on 'family management' and 'cooperation in childcare between mothers with depressive symptoms and their 'mother-in-law'. Another study found that significantly more mothers continue to breastfeed in the intervention group compared to the control group at 12 weeks postpartum as a positive outcome in co-parenting. Conclusion: Co-parenting interventions have demonstrated some positive effects on co-parenting support, co-parenting undermining, couple communication, parent-child interactions of parents and the depressive symptoms of mothers. Limited evidence was found on the overall effects on co-parenting, division of labor, childrearing agreement, the psychological health of fathers, parenting self-efficacy and baby feeding practices. Further studies are recommended to examine the effects of interventions for intergenerational (parent-grandparent) families on co-parenting, the psychological health in parenting, parenting self-efficacy and baby feeding practices during the postpartum period by adopting online approaches.","Affiliations 1 School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China; Outpatient Department, Affiliated Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China. 2 School of Nursing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China.

351,Amino Acids in Dog Nutrition and Health,"The dog has assumed a prominent role in human society. Associated with that status, diet choices for companion dogs have begun to reflect the personal preferences of the owners, with greater emphasis on specialty diets such as organic, vegan/vegetarian, and omission or inclusion of specific ingredients. Despite consumer preferences and many marketing strategies employed, the diets must ensure nutritional adequacy for the dog; if not, health becomes compromised, sometimes severely. The most frequent consideration of consumers and dog food manufacturers is protein source and concentration with a growing emphasis on amino acid composition and bioavailability. Amino acids in general play diverse and critical roles in the dog, with specific amino acids being essential. This review covers what is known regarding amino acids in dog nutrition.","Affiliations 1 Department of Animal Science, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA, USA. amoberbauer@ucdavis.edu. 2 Department of Molecular Biosciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.","Anita M Oberbauer , Jennifer A Larsen ",Adv Exp Med Biol,2021,"Review,Amino Acids*,Animal Feed* / analysis,Animals,Biological Availability,Diet / veterinary,Dogs,Nutritional Status,Amino Acids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33770408

355,Effects of Nutrition Education Interventions in Team Sport Players. A Systematic Review,"Considering nutrition education interventions have been frequently implemented in team sport athletes and have shown promising results, this study aimed to summarize the effects of nutrition education interventions on eating habits, nutrition knowledge, body composition, and physical performance in team sport athletes. A systematic review was conducted using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus. A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated, and each study was assessed according to the analyzed variables (i.e., eating habits, nutrition knowledge, body composition, and physical performance). Most studies showed improvements in or maintenance of variables used to indicate eating habits, nutrition knowledge, and body composition. However, limited studies examined the effect of nutrition education interventions on physical performance, with existing studies demonstrating disparate results. These findings suggest implementation of nutrition education interventions in team sport athletes could be an effective strategy to improve their eating habits, nutrition knowledge, and body composition. Due to the heterogeneity across the included studies regarding sport modality, competition level, age, and sex of the athletes investigated, as well as the intervention type adopted (i.e., online or face-to-face), it is difficult to establish optimal nutrition education interventions for each analyzed variable.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Isabel I, 09003 Burgos, Spain. 2 Society, Sports and Physical Exercise Research Group (GIKAFIT), Physical Education and Sport Department, Faculty of Education and Sport, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, 01007 Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. 3 Human Exercise and Training Laboratory, Central Queensland University, School of Health, Medical and Applied Sciences, Rockhampton 4702, Australia.","Silvia Sánchez-Díaz , Javier Yanci , Daniel Castillo , Aaron T Scanlan , Javier Raya-González ",Nutrients,2020 Nov 28,"Systematic Review,Athletes*,Health Education*,Humans,Nutritional Sciences / education*,Team Sports*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33260504
356,Pre-sleep social media use does not strongly disturb sleep: a sleep laboratory study in healthy young participants,"Objective: Sleep is critical for our mental health and optimal cognitive functioning. Social media use is increasingly common and suspected to disturb sleep due to increasing bedtime arousal. However, most studies rely on self-reported sleep. Methods: We tested the effects of 30 min social media use on arousal and subsequent sleep in the sleep laboratory in 32 healthy young volunteers. Effects of blue-light were excluded in this study. We compared it to 30 min progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and neutral sleep in a within-subject design. Results: Thirty minutes of social media use immediately before sleep did not significantly increase arousal and did neither disturb objective nor subjective sleep. After social media use, participants only spent less time in sleep stage N2. In contrast, PMR had the expected positive effects on pre-sleep arousal level indicated by reduced heart rate. In addition, PMR improved sleep efficiency, reduced sleep onset latency, and shortened the time to reach slow-wave sleep compared to a neutral night. Oscillatory power in the slow-wave activity and spindle bands remained unaffected. Conclusion: Social media use before sleep (controlling for effects of blue-light) had little effect on bedtime arousal and sleep quality than what was previously expected. The most notable effect appears to be the additional time spent engaging in social media use at bedtime, potentially keeping people from going to sleep. As wake up-time is mostly determined externally, due to school or working hours, limiting personal media use at bedtime-and especially in bed-is recommended to get sufficient hours of sleep.","Affiliations 1 University of Fribourg, Department of Psychology, Fribourg, Switzerland. 2 University of Lucerne, Department of Health Sciences and Medicine, Lucerne, Switzerland. 3 University of Fribourg, Department of Communication and Media Research, Fribourg, Switzerland. 4 University of Fribourg, Department of Psychology, Fribourg, Switzerland.

357,The Association Between Sleep and Metabolic Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Purpose: Sleep duration is thought to play a key role in the development of metabolic syndrome. However, the results have been inconsistent. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies and searched publications in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.gov. The summary relative risks (RRs) were estimated using a random model. The sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially excluding each study to test the robustness of the pooled estimates. Finding: We included 13 studies involving 300,202 patients in which short sleep and long sleep significantly increased the risk of metabolic syndrome 15% (RR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.09-1.22, p < 0.001) and 19% (RR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.05-1.35, p < 0.001). Moreover, the relationship between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome risk presented a U-shaped curve. Short and long sleep increased the risk of obesity by 14% (RR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.07-1.22, p<0.001) and 15% (RR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.00-1.30, p = 0.04), and high blood pressure 16% (RR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.02-1.31, p = 0.03) and 13% (RR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.04-1.24, p = 0.01), respectively. Short sleep can potentially increase the risk of high blood sugar by 12% (RR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.00-1.15, P = 0.05). Implications: Based on our findings, sleep is a behavior that can be changed and is economical. Clinically doctors and health professionals should be encouraged to increase their efforts to promote healthy sleep for all people.","Affiliations 1 NHC Key Laboratory of Hormones and Development, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Metabolic Diseases, Chu Hsien-I Memorial Hospital & Tianjin Institute of Endocrinology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. 2 Department of Neurology, Chu Hsien-I Memorial Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.","Tingting Che , Cheng Yan , Dingyuan Tian , Xin Zhang , Xuejun Liu , Zhongming Wu ",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),2021 Nov 19,"Meta-Analysis,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Systematic Review,Humans,Hypertension / physiopathology*,Metabolic Syndrome / physiopathology*,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Quality",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867820
358,"Herbal medicine use among patients with viral and non-viral Hepatitis in Uganda: prevalence, patterns and related factors","Background: There is some evidence that patients with liver diseases commonly use complementary and alternative therapies to address general and liver-disease specific health concerns. The purpose of this study was to assess and describe prevalence, patterns and related factors of herbal medicine use among adults diagnosed with viral and non-viral hepatitis in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 310 adult patients attending the gastrointestinal clinic in Mulago hospital referral hospital in Kampala. Data on prevalence, types and reasons for herbal medicine use was collected using standardized questionnaires and focus group discussions. Modified Poisson regression analyses were used to examine factors related to use. Results: Usage of various herbal remedies within 12 months prior to April 2018 was reported by 46.1% (143/310) of patients with 27.3% (39/143) of these reporting having used conventional and herbal therapies concurrently. Herbal remedies were used to treat various health conditions including hepatitis. Patients with hepatitis C virus infection (PRR = 1.16, p = 0.02) compared to those with hepatitis B virus infection, and those who believed that it was safe to use herbal and conventional therapies concurrently (PRR = 1.23, p = 0.008) had higher prevalence odds of herbal medicine use. Conversely, patients who had been newly diagnosed with hepatitis (PRR = 0.69, p = 0.03) compared to those who had been diagnosed more than one-year prior, had lower prevalence odds of herbal medicine use. Various types of local herbs were reported as most commonly used however most patients did not know the ingredients of commercially prepared herbal therapies. Conclusion: A high prevalence of herbal medicine use was found among newly-diagnosed patients and patients with hepatitis C more likely to use herbal remedies after adjusting for other factors. Usage was influenced by the belief that herbal medicine is safe and effective. Health workers need to consistently elicit information about herbal remedy use. Research is needed on benefits, adverse effects and outcomes in patients who use herbal remedies to treat primary liver diseases in order to facilitate evidence of efficacy and product safety.","Affiliations 1 Infectious Disease Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. snsibirwa@yahoo.com. 2 Infectious Disease Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. 3 School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.","Sara Nsibirwa , Godwin Anguzu , Sam Kamukama , Ponsiano Ocama , Joan Nankya-Mutyoba ",BMC Complement Med Ther,2020 Jun 3,"Adolescent,Adult,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Hepatitis / drug therapy*,Hepatitis, Viral, Human / drug therapy*,Herbal Medicine / statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Phytotherapy / statistics & numerical data*,Prevalence,Surveys and Questionnaires,Uganda,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32493310

Adolf Thierry de Chateauvieux (St. Pölten, 1854 - Pregrada, 1920), a nobleman hailing from France, immigrated to Croatia at the end of the 19 th century. He bought the Angjelu čuvaru ( Guardian Angel ) pharmacy (1892) in the small town of Pregrada and established the first pharmaceutical factory (1894) in this part of Europe. The factory had an equipped laboratory, a production facility, a storage room for raw materials and balsams, a room for packaging and shipping finished products and a commercial office. Production was mainly based on herbal remedies. The most famous were Thierry's Balsam and Thierry's Centifolia Ointment, both registered and patented in London (1900). By virtue of Adolf Thierry's entrepreneurial spirit and skilful product advertisement, his medicinal preparations were distributed across Europe, America, India and Africa, a testament to which is the well-preserved and researched documentation.","Affiliations 1 University of Zagreb, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Croatia;, Email: sinic@pharma.hr. 2 University of Zagreb, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Croatia.","S Inić , V Flegar ",Pharmazie,2021 Feb 25,"Biography,Historical Article,Croatia,Drug Industry / history*,Europe,Herbal Medicine,History, 18th Century,Humans,Occupational Medicine / history,Pharmaceutical Preparations / history*,Pharmaceutical Preparations,Adolf Thierry",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33714290
360,The efficacy of mindful parenting interventions: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Mindful parenting is the process of bringing awareness and attention intentionally in a non-reactive and non-judgemental way to a child at any present moment. Parenting mindfulness is believed to influence parenting factors and parental psychological outcomes, child's emotional and behavioural outcomes, and family relationships. However, the efficacy of such interventions on interpersonal mindfulness in parenting and parenting behaviours has received minimal empirical attention. Objective: This meta-analysis aims to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of mindful parenting interventions on parenting mindfulness and parenting behaviours. Parenting stress, parents' psychological wellbeing, interpersonal relationships, and child behavioural outcomes were examined secondarily. When meta-analysis was not possible (due to insufficient data in the included studies), the narrative approach was taken to present the findings. Design: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative summary. Methods: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) were systematically searched for articles in the English language from their respective dates of inception to December 2020. Studies involving clinical and non-clinical samples of parents with children or youths aged 24 years and below were included. Only randomised controlled trials were included. Studies were excluded if the mindfulness intervention did not focus on parenting skills training; that is, it focused on childbirth, stress reduction or incorporated other forms of therapy (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy). Data was synthesised using a random-effects model in RevMan 5.4. The outcomes of primary interest were parenting mindfulness and parenting behaviours. The secondary outcomes were parenting stress, parents' psychological wellbeing, interpersonal relationships, and child behavioural outcomes. Results: Eleven studies representing 1,340 parents from six countries were included in the review. No evidence of intervention effect was found for overall parenting mindfulness and overall parenting stress. However, mindful parenting interventions demonstrated a moderate effect size when examining parenting mindfulness scores (standardised mean differences (d)=0.62, 95% CI: 0.11, 1.13, p = 0.02) of parents with non-clinical samples of children. No intervention effect was found for overall parenting stress. Due to insufficient studies and data, findings on parenting behaviours, psychological wellbeing, relationships, and child behaviour were presented narratively. Conclusion: Mindful parenting interventions are associated with higher parenting mindfulness scores for parents of typically developing children when compared with a control group. The limited studies and mixed results on positive parenting behaviours, parental psychological wellbeing, parental relationship with child and partner, and child behavioural outcomes serve as an impetus for further research.","Affiliations 1 Alice Lee Center for Nursing Studies, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

362,"[Parenting capacity: Definitions, indicators, and assessment]","Parenting capacity: Definitions, indicators, and assessment Abstract. Parenting capacity is a broadly defined term that refers to the ability of parents to meet their children's needs. The assessment of parenting capacity is crucial to child-protection concerns and often an essential task in psychological evaluations for family law proceedings. Despite the relevance of the construct as a factor influencing child development and its frequent use in normative legal decisions, there is little consensus in the psychological literature regarding the definition of the construct. This literature review identifies, analyzes, and systemizes the national and international definitions of parenting capacity and the associated indicators. Following a comprehensive literature search, we included the work of 12 authors in this analysis. After checking for overlaps in content, we were able to categorize 58 indicators of parenting capacity into 29 different groups of indicators. The literature review also identifies German instruments that assess the construct of parenting capacity and its limitation. No instrument exists in the German literature which explicitly measures the parenting capacity as a construct. We did, however, identify five instruments that measure related constructs. We evaluated these instruments for their psychometric quality and their applicability in the context of psychological evaluation in family law. We discuss the diagnostic relevance of the identified definitions and indicators of parenting capacity as well as the practicality of the assessment instruments for psychological evaluations in family law proceedings.",Affiliations 1 Psychologische Hochschule Berlin. 2 Die Autorinnen haben zu gleichen Teilen zu diesem Beitrag beigetragen.,"Jelena Zumbach , Anna Oster ",Z Kinder Jugendpsychiatr Psychother,2021 Jan,"Review,Child,Child Development*,Humans,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Psychology, Child*,Psychometrics",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33243078
363,Potential herbal constituents for psoriasis treatment as protective and effective therapy,"Psoriasis is a multifactorial and chronic skin disorder. It is a recurrent disease that requires incessant therapy. Psoriasis treatment includes topical and systemic routes using synthetic drugs that lead to severe unwanted adverse effects. Herbal therapy is widely used for thousands of years in countries like China and India. The use of herbal therapy in the developed region enhanced to a great extent and showed better efficacy towards psoriasis alone or as adjuvant to synthetic therapy. Herbal medicines have gained great attention in the treatment of psoriasis due to their lesser side effects compared to synthetic drugs. In this review, the various plant sources which have been found effective in psoriasis and can be used to develop novel therapeutics have been discussed. The mechanisms by which the phytoconstituents elicit anti-psoriatic activity and various research studies that have proven the effectiveness of these natural products have also been compiled in this review.","Affiliation 1 Industrial Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.","Neha Dabholkar , Vamshi K Rapalli , Gautam Singhvi ",Phytother Res,2020 Dec 5.,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33277958
364,Fibromyalgia and Nutrition: An Updated Review,"Due to the lack of specific and standardized treatments for the management of fibromyalgia (FM), available evidence suggests a multidisciplinary approach, and nutrition represents an important therapeutic strategy. This work aims to update the relationship between FM and nutrition, through a review of more recent scientific evidence based on a systematic research on PubMed. Of 66 records initially identified, 26 studies were selected and included in the present work. Although there is not sufficient evidence for the efficacy of specific nutritional protocols, the examined papers indicate a potential role of selected nutrients, micronutrients and food components in managing FM symptoms. However, several concerns persist as nutritional status and/or nutritional integration can improve FM symptoms, without expecting to lead to a remission of the disease. The use of targeted nutritional supplements may be of some relevance for the management of FM, but the up to date evidence remains weak. It is advisable, thus, to perform further studies of higher quality.KEY TEACHING POINTSFibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic and diffuse musculoskeletal pain, often associated with a large set of symptoms.The therapeutic approach of FM include pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Among them, an important role is played by nutrition.Of 66 record screened, 12 studies were included in the present review and five of them were randomized controlled trials. Nevertheless, the overall quality of those trials was scarce.Literature concerning FM and nutritions is growing. However, little evidence suggests that nutrition and/or nutritional intervention play a significant role on FM severity.The results of this review underline the need to carry out clinical studies of higher quality and rigor, possibly RCTs, focused on the role of nutrition in the symptoms and/or severity of FM.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health (DISCCO), Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy. 2 Research Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences (IUIBS), Preventive Medicine Service, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain. 3 Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y la Nutrición (CIBEROBN), Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. 4 Department of Preventive Medicine, Occupational Health Unit ""L.Devoto"", Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. 5 Servizio di Dietetica, Direzione Sanitaria di Presidio, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. 6 Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. 7 Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.","Laura Tomaino , Lluís Serra-Majem , Stefania Martini , Maria Rosaria Ingenito , Paola Rossi , Carlo La Vecchia , Fabrizia Bamonti , Luisella Vigna ",J Am Coll Nutr,2021 Sep-Oct,"Review,Dietary Supplements,Fibromyalgia* / therapy,Humans,Micronutrients,Nutritional Status,Pain,Micronutrients",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32902371

Nine healthy young male subjects participated in this study. Two interventions, modeling the sleep environments of evacuation shelters (evacuation shelter trial) and car seats (car trial), were compared with sleep at home (control trial). Physiological data were measured using portable two-channel electroencephalogram and electrooculogram monitoring systems, wearable heart rate sensors, and flash glucose monitors. Wake after sleep onset (WASO) and stage shift were greater in both intervention trials than the control trial, while rapid-eye movement (REM) latency and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) 1 were longer and REM duration was shorter in the evacuation shelter trial than the control trial. Glucose dynamics and power at low frequency (LF.p) of heart rate variability were higher in the car trial than in the control trial.

366,Sleep in the Natural Environment: A Pilot Study,"Sleep quality has been directly linked to cognitive function, quality of life, and a variety of serious diseases across many clinical domains. Standard methods for assessing sleep involve overnight studies in hospital settings, which are uncomfortable, expensive, not representative of real sleep, and difficult to conduct on a large scale. Recently, numerous commercial digital devices have been developed that record physiological data, such as movement, heart rate, and respiratory rate, which can act as a proxy for sleep quality in lieu of standard electroencephalogram recording equipment. The sleep-related output metrics from these devices include sleep staging and total sleep duration and are derived via proprietary algorithms that utilize a variety of these physiological recordings. Each device company makes different claims of accuracy and measures different features of sleep quality, and it is still unknown how well these devices correlate with one another and perform in a research setting. In this pilot study of 21 participants, we investigated whether sleep metric outputs from self-reported sleep metrics (SRSMs) and four sensors, specifically Fitbit Surge (a smart watch), Withings Aura (a sensor pad that is placed under a mattress), Hexoskin (a smart shirt), and Oura Ring (a smart ring), were related to known cognitive and psychological metrics, including the n-back test and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We analyzed correlation between multiple device-related sleep metrics. Furthermore, we investigated relationships between these sleep metrics and cognitive scores across different timepoints and SRSM through univariate linear regressions. We found that correlations for sleep metrics between the devices across the sleep cycle were almost uniformly low, but still significant (P < 0.05). For cognitive scores, we found the Withings latency was statistically significant for afternoon and evening timepoints at P = 0.016 and P = 0.013. We did not find any significant associations between SRSMs and PSQI or cognitive scores. Additionally, Oura Ring's total sleep duration and efficiency in relation to the PSQI measure was statistically significant at P = 0.004 and P = 0.033, respectively. These findings can hopefully be used to guide future sensor-based sleep research.","Affiliations 1 Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10032, USA. 2 Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10032, USA. 3 Institute for Next Generation Healthcare, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10032, USA. 4 The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10032, USA. 5 Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York 10032, USA.","Fayzan F Chaudhry , Matteo Danieletto , Eddye Golden , Jerome Scelza , Greg Botwin , Mark Shervey , Jessica K De Freitas , Ishan Paranjpe , Girish N Nadkarni , Riccardo Miotto , Patricia Glowe , Greg Stock , Bethany Percha , Noah Zimmerman , Joel T Dudley , Benjamin S Glicksberg ",Sensors (Basel),2020 Mar 3,"Adult,Cognition,Environment*,Female,Humans,Male,Pilot Projects,Self Report,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Stages / physiology,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32138289
367,Chinese Herbal Medicine Interventions in Neurological Disorder Therapeutics by Regulating Glutamate Signaling,"Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its signaling is critical for excitatory synaptic transmission. The well-established glutamate system involves glutamate synthesis, presynaptic glutamate release, glutamate actions on the ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors) and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and glutamate uptake by glutamate transporters. When the glutamate system becomes dysfunctional, it contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, epilepsy, and ischemic stroke. In this review, based on regulating glutamate signaling, we summarize the effects and underlying mechanisms of natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicines on neurological disorders. Natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicine can prevent the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity via suppressing presynaptic glutamate release, decreasing ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors expression in the excitatory synapse, and promoting astroglial glutamate transporter expression to increase glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft. However, some natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicine have the ability to restore the collapse of excitatory synapses by promoting presynaptic glutamate release and increasing ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors expression. These regulatory processes involve various signaling pathways, which lead to different mechanistic routes of protection against neurological disorders. Hence, our review addresses the underlying mechanisms of natural constituents from Chinese herbal medicines that regulate glutamate systems and serve as promising agents for the treatment of the above-mentioned neurological disorders.","Affiliations 1 Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China. 2 Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China. 3 Department of Biology, Center of Pain Medicine and Medical School, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China. 4 Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510006, China. 5 Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China. 6 Neuroscience Initiative, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, United States. 7 Department of Cardiology, Shunde Hospital, Southern Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Shunde Foshan), Foshan 528300, China. 8 Shenzhen Research Institute of Xiamen University, Shenzhen 518000, China.","Yan Liu , Shan Wang , Jun Kan , Jingzhi Zhang , Lisa Zhou , Yuli Huang , Yunlong Zhang ",Curr Neuropharmacol,2020,"Review,Animals,Brain / drug effects*,Brain / metabolism,Drugs, Chinese Herbal / administration & dosage*,Glutamic Acid / metabolism*,Humans,Medicine, Chinese Traditional / methods*,Nervous System Diseases / drug therapy*,Neurons / drug effects*,Neurons / metabolism,Signal Transduction / drug effects,Synaptic Transmission / drug effects,Drugs, Chinese Herbal,Glutamic Acid",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31686629
368,Does sleep protect memories against interference? A failure to replicate,"Across a broad spectrum of memory tasks, retention is superior following a night of sleep compared to a day of wake. However, this result alone does not clarify whether sleep merely slows the forgetting that would otherwise occur as a result of information processing during wakefulness, or whether sleep actually consolidates memories, protecting them from subsequent retroactive interference. Two influential studies suggested that sleep protects memories against the subsequent retroactive interference that occurs when participants learn new yet overlapping information (interference learning). In these studies, interference learning was much less detrimental to memory following a night of sleep compared to a day of wakefulness, an indication that sleep supports this important aspect of memory consolidation. In the current replication study, we repeated the protocol of and, additionally, we examined the impact of intrinsic motivation on performance in sleep and wake participants. We were unable to replicate the finding that sleep protects memories against retroactive interference, with the detrimental effects of interference learning being essentially the same in wake and sleep participants. We also found that while intrinsic motivation benefitted task acquisition it was not a modulator of sleep-wake differences in memory processing. Although we cannot accept the null hypothesis that sleep has no role to play in reducing the negative impact of interference, the findings draw into question prior evidence for sleep's role in protecting memories against interference. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of replicating key findings in the study of sleep's impact on memory processing before drawing strong conclusions that set the direction of future research.","Affiliations 1 University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville, Greenville, South Carolina. 2 Department of Psychology and Program in Neuroscience, Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina.","Carrie Bailes , Mary Caldwell , Erin J Wamsley , Matthew A Tucker ",PLoS One,2020 Feb 13,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adolescent,Adult,Data Accuracy*,Female,Humans,Male,Memory Consolidation / physiology*,Memory and Learning Tests,Mental Recall / physiology*,Motivation / physiology,Reproducibility of Results,Sleep / physiology*,Wakefulness / physiology*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32053586

Participants included 243 preschool children (M age = 4.60 years) and their parents. Findings from cross-lagged autoregressive models conducted with multimethod (survey and observations), multi-informant (parent, teacher, and observer), longitudinal (three annual waves of data collection) data indicated that experiences with heightened family instability predicted decreases in supportive parenting, which in turn predicted increases in children's externalizing symptoms. Analyses also revealed a bidirectional association between parenting and family instability over time, such that higher levels of instability predicted decreases in supportive parenting, which in turn predicted increases in family instability.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA. 2 Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.","Jesse L Coe , Patrick T Davies , Rochelle F Hentges , Melissa L Sturge-Apple ",Dev Psychopathol,2020 Feb,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aggression / psychology*,Child,Child Behavior / psychology*,Child, Preschool,Family Conflict / psychology*,Female,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology,Problem Behavior / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30732672
370,Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture Combined Treatment Attenuates Colitis in Rats,"This study aimed to verify the efficacy of a combined treatment of Jakyakgamcho-tang (JGT) and acupuncture (CV12, ST25, CV4) on colitis induced by dextrane sulfate sodium (DSS). Changes in immuno-mediated factors and metabolites were investigated. Colitis symptoms such as body weight loss and elevated disease activity index were alleviated by the combined treatment. Moreover, treatment with JGT and acupuncture restored the disturbed architecture of colon by suppressing inflammatory cytokine levels of IFN-[Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] < 0.05), IL-5 ([Formula: see text] < 0.05), and IL-13 ([Formula: see text] < 0.0001) compared with the DSS group. Analysis of metabolic profiles of serum revealed that treatment groups were clearly separated from the DSS group, suggesting that JGT and acupuncture treatment altered serum metabolites. Furthermore, treatments caused opposite metabolite patterns for dimethylbenzimidazole, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, proline, phosphate, glycolic acid, aspartic acid, tryptophan, phthalic acid, ornithine, and glutamic acid compared with the DSS group. The combined treatment group induced more effective metabolite patterns than the JGT group, implying that acupuncture treatment can restore metabolic changes caused by DSS induction. These results indicate that the simultaneous treatment of JGT administration and acupuncture procedure provides better management of the immune function and inflammatory expression of colitis than a single treatment. It is assumed that intestinal microbial control can be achieved by acupuncture stimulation as well as by taking herbal medicine.","Affiliations 1 College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, Jeollanam-do 58245, Korea. 2 Department of Health Administration, Dongshin University, Naju, Jeollanam-do, Korea. 3 College of Korean Medicine Daegu Haany University Daegu 42158, Korea. 4 School of Biomedical Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia. 5 Department of Food Biosciences and Technology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea.","Yu-Mi Lee , Seung-Ho Seo , Seong-Young Cho , Dong-Hee Choi , Min-Woo Cheon , Hee-Young Kim , Dae-Hwan Youn , Sok Cheon Pak , Hong-Seok Son , Chang-Su Na ",Am J Chin Med,2021,"Acupuncture Therapy / methods*,Animals,Colitis / therapy*,Combined Modality Therapy,Dextran Sulfate,Disease Models, Animal,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Inflammation / drug therapy*,Male,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Dextran Sulfate",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33827383
371,Genes and Diet in the Prevention of Chronic Diseases in Future Generations,"Nutrition is a modifiable key factor that is able to interact with both the genome and epigenome to influence human health and fertility. In particular, specific genetic variants can influence the response to dietary components and nutrient requirements, and conversely, the diet itself is able to modulate gene expression. In this context and the era of precision medicine, nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic studies offer significant opportunities to improve the prevention of metabolic disturbances, such as Type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, even with transgenerational effects. The present review takes into account the interactions between diet, genes and human health, and provides an overview of the role of nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics and epigenetics in the prevention of non-communicable diseases. Moreover, we focus our attention on the mechanism of intergenerational or transgenerational transmission of the susceptibility to metabolic disturbances, and underline that the reversibility of epigenetic modifications through dietary intervention could counteract perturbations induced by lifestyle and environmental factors.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine and Aging, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, 'G. d'Annunzio' University of Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. 2 Center for Advanced Studies and Technology (CAST), 'G. d'Annunzio' University of Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. 3 DISC-Diversified Integrated Sport Clinic, Dubai 00000, UAE. 4 Department of Psychological, Health and Territorial Sciences, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, 'G. d'Annunzio' University of Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy.","Marica Franzago , Daniele Santurbano , Ester Vitacolonna , Liborio Stuppia ",Int J Mol Sci,2020 Apr 10,"Review,Chronic Disease,Diet*,Disease Susceptibility*,Epigenesis, Genetic,Genetic Background*,Health Status,Humans,Nutrigenomics,Nutritional Status,Primary Prevention*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32290086

375,Nutrition and Genetics in NAFLD: The Perfect Binomium,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a global healthcare burden since it is epidemiologically related to obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). It embraces a wide spectrum of hepatic injuries, which include simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The susceptibility to develop NAFLD is highly variable and it is influenced by several cues including environmental (i.e., dietary habits and physical activity) and inherited (i.e., genetic/epigenetic) risk factors. Nonetheless, even intestinal microbiota and its by-products play a crucial role in NAFLD pathophysiology. The interaction of dietary exposure with the genome is referred to as 'nutritional genomics,' which encompasses both 'nutrigenetics' and 'nutriepigenomics.' It is focused on revealing the biological mechanisms that entail both the acute and persistent genome-nutrient interactions that influence health and it may represent a promising field of study to improve both clinical and health nutrition practices. Thus, the premise of this review is to discuss the relevance of personalized nutritional advices as a novel therapeutic approach in NAFLD tailored management.","Affiliations 1 General Medicine and Metabolic Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Pad.

376,Aristolochia Herbs and Iatrogenic Disease: The Case of Portland's Powders,"Aristolochia herbals have a 2500-year history of medicinal use. We focused this article on Portland's Powders, an 18th-century British gout medicine containing Aristolochia herbs. The powders constitute an 18th-century iteration of an herbal remedy, which was used, with variations, since at least the fifth century BCE. The use of Portland's Powders in Great Britain may appear to be an unusual choice for investigating a public health problem currently widespread in Asia. Yet it exemplifies long-term medicinal use of Aristolochia herbs, reflecting our argument that aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) is a historically persistent iatrogenic disease. Moreover, we provide compelling evidence that individuals taking Portland's Powders for gout would have ingested toxic quantities of aristolochic acid, which causes AAN and cancer. Several factors, including long history of use, latency of toxic effects, and lack of effective regulation, perpetuate usage of Aristolochia herbals to the present day.","Affiliations 1 Department of History, Colgate University, Hamilton, NY. 2 Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY.","Tristan Tomlinson , Andrea Fernandes , Arthur P Grollman ",Yale J Biol Med,2020 Jun 29,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aristolochia / chemistry*,Aristolochic Acids / pharmacology*,Carcinogens / pharmacology,Gout / drug therapy,Gout Suppressants / pharmacology,History,Humans,Iatrogenic Disease / prevention & control,Kidney Diseases* / chemically induced,Kidney Diseases* / prevention & control,Long Term Adverse Effects* / chemically induced,Long Term Adverse Effects* / physiopathology,Long Term Adverse Effects* / prevention & control,Phytotherapy* / adverse effects,Phytotherapy* / methods,Aristolochic Acids,Carcinogens,Gout Suppressants,aristolochic acid I",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32607094
377,Study on the bacteriostatic action of Chinese herbal medicine on avian Trichosporon,"In this study, a strain of Trichosporon was isolated from white pseudomembranes and ulcers formed on mucous membranes of pigeon bursas and was identified through gene sequencing. Bacteriostatic actions of Acorus gramineus, Sophora flavescens, Polygonum hydropiper, and Chinese herbal mixture on this species were explored in vitro, and the minimum inhibitory concentration of herbal medicines against Trichosporon was determined through microdilution method. Therapeutic effects of herbal medicines on chickens infected by Trichosporon were studied, whose results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration of A. gramineus was 32 μg/μL, that of S. flavescens was 2 μg/μL, that of P. hydropiper was 120 μg/μL, and that of Chinese herbal mixture was 36 μg/μL. Antibacterial effects of S. flavescens were the best. In accordance with animal experiments, therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicines on infected chickens were better than those of fluconazole. The mortality rate of the Chinese herbal medicine treatment group was 33.33%, that of the fluconazole treatment group was 46.67%, and that of the Chinese medicine protection group was 23.33%. The longer the time of Chinese medicine treatments was, the better the treatment effects would be. Glutamic oxaloacetylase values of the serum and liver in the Chinese herbal medicine treatment group were both significantly lower than those of the nontreatment group. From the results, it can be seen that A. gramineus, S. flavescens, P. hydropiper, and Chinese herbal mixture have certain inhibitory effects on Trichosporon spp. Chinese herbal medicine protections in advance could reduce Trichosporon infections.","Affiliations 1 The College of Veterinary Medicine, Agricultural University of Hebei, Baoding 071001, China. 2 The College of Veterinary Medicine, Agricultural University of Hebei, Baoding 071001, China.

The disease is basically characterized by hurdles in social interaction where the individuals demonstrate repetitive and stereotyped interests or patterns of behavior. A wide number of neuroanatomical studies with autistic patients revealed alterations in brain development which lead to diverse cellular and anatomical processes including atypical neurogenesis, neuronal migration, maturation, differentiation, and degeneration. Special education programs, speech and language therapy, have been employed for the amelioration of behavioral deficits in autism. Although commonly prescribed antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and stimulants have revealed satisfactory responses in autistic individuals, adverse side effects and increased risk of several other complications including obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, etc. have compelled the researchers to turn their attention toward herbal remedies. Alternative approaches with natural compounds are on continuous clinical trial to confirm their efficacy and to understand their potential in autism treatment.

381,Malnutrition and Gut Microbiota in Children,"Malnutrition continues to threaten the lives of millions across the world, with children being hardest hit. Although inadequate access to food and infectious disease are the primary causes of childhood malnutrition, the gut microbiota may also contribute. This review considers the evidence on the role of diet in modifying the gut microbiota, and how the microbiota impacts childhood malnutrition. It is widely understood that the gut microbiota of children is influenced by diet, which, in turn, can impact child nutritional status. Additionally, diarrhoea, a major contributor to malnutrition, is induced by pathogenic elements of the gut microbiota. Diarrhoea leads to malabsorption of essential nutrients and reduced energy availability resulting in weight loss, which can lead to malnutrition. Alterations in gut microbiota of severe acute malnourished (SAM) children include increased Proteobacteria and decreased Bacteroides levels. Additionally, the gut microbiota of SAM children exhibits lower relative diversity compared with healthy children. Thus, the data indicate a link between gut microbiota and malnutrition in children, suggesting that treatment of childhood malnutrition should include measures that support a healthy gut microbiota. This could be of particular relevance in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia where prevalence of malnutrition remains a major threat to the lives of millions.","Affiliations 1 Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading RG6 6AX, UK. 2 Unilever R&D, Colworth Park, Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire MK44 1LQ, UK. 3 Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Khyber Medical University, Peshawar 25100, Pakistan. 4 School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading RG6 6AX, UK.","Ishawu Iddrisu , Andrea Monteagudo-Mera , Carlos Poveda , Simone Pyle , Muhammad Shahzad , Simon Andrews , Gemma Emily Walton ",Nutrients,2021 Aug 8,"Review,Child,Child Nutrition Disorders / microbiology*,Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena*,Child, Preschool,Diarrhea / microbiology,Female,Gastrointestinal Microbiome*,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Male,Nutritional Status*,Severe Acute Malnutrition / microbiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444887

383,Sleep abnormalities in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis,"Youth at clinical high risk (CHR) represent a unique population enriched for precursors of major psychiatric disorders. Sleep disturbances are consistently reported in CHR individuals. However, there is a dearth of studies investigating quantifiable objective measures of sleep dysfunction in CHR youth. In this study, sleep high density (hd)-EEG recordings were collected in twenty-two CHR and twenty healthy control (HC) subjects. Sleep architecture parameters, as well as sleep EEG power spectra in five frequency bands, were computed and compared between CHR and HC groups during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Furthermore, correlation analyses between sleep EEG power spectra, sleep architecture parameters, and clinical symptoms, assessed with the scale of prodromal symptoms (SOPS), were conducted in CHR participants. Our results show that CHR individuals had more wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) compared to HC participants. CHR also showed a higher NREM sleep gamma EEG power, which was observed in a large fronto-parieto-occipital area, relative to HC. Additionally, higher NREM gamma activity in lateral fronto-occipital regions was associated with more WASO, and increased NREM gamma power in medial fronto/parietal areas correlated with worse SOPS negative symptoms. Altogether, these findings suggest that topographically specific increases in EEG gamma activity during NREM sleep represent neurophysiological signatures underlying some of the objectively assessed sleep disturbances and clinical symptoms of CHR individuals.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, USA. 2 Center for Molecular Protein Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. 3 Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, USA.

384,Predicting the Outcomes of Parents of Transition-Age Youth or Young Adults with ASD,"The transition outcomes for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families are less than desirable. A survey of parent stressors, resources, coping/appraisals, and adaptation to transition was completed by 226 parents. The mediating mechanisms between stressors and parent outcomes were identified. At the indicator level, three stressors (i.e., autism severity, mental health crisis/challenging behaviors, and filial obligation), four resources (i.e., general social support, transition planning quality, parent-teacher alliance, and parenting efficacy), and three coping styles (i.e., problem-focused coping, avoidance-focused coping, and optimism) predicted parents' outcomes (i.e., burden, transition experience, subjective health, and quality of life). At the structural level, optimism, emotion-coping strategies, and resources mediated the relationships between stressors and parental outcomes.

385,The Role of miR-155 in Nutrition: Modulating Cancer-Associated Inflammation,"Nutrition plays an important role in overall human health. Although there is no direct evidence supporting the direct involvement of nutrition in curing disease, for some diseases, good nutrition contributes to disease prevention and our overall well-being, including energy level, optimum internal function, and strength of the immune system. Lately, other major, but more silent players are reported to participate in the body's response to ingested nutrients, as they are involved in different physiological and pathological processes. Furthermore, the genetic profile of an individual is highly critical in regulating these processes and their interactions. In particular, miR-155, a non-coding microRNA, is reported to be highly correlated with such nutritional processes. In fact, miR-155 is involved in the orchestration of various biological processes such as cellular signaling, immune regulation, metabolism, nutritional responses, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. Thus, this review aims to highlight those critical aspects of the influence of dietary components on gene expression, primarily on miR-155 and its role in modulating cancer-associated processes.","Affiliations 1 Research Center for Functional Genomics, Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 23 Marinescu Street, 40015 Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 2 Department of Surgery, ""Octavian Fodor,"" Regional Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 400162 Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 3 Department of Surgery, University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 19-21 Croitorilor Street, 400162 Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 4 Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care I, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 19-21 Croitorilor Street, 400162 Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 5 Prof. Dr. Octavian Fodor Regional Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 19-21 Croitorilor Street, 400162 Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 6 Department of Natural and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.","Oana Zanoaga , Cornelia Braicu , Paul Chiroi , Nutu Andreea , Nadim Al Hajjar , Simona Mărgărit , Schuyler S Korban , Ioana Berindan-Neagoe ",Nutrients,2021 Jun 29,"Review,Humans,MicroRNAs / metabolism*,Neoplasms / genetics,Nutritional Physiological Phenomena / genetics*,Nutritional Status / genetics*,MIRN155 microRNA, human,MicroRNAs",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34210046
386,The Nutrition-COVID-19 Interplay: a Review,"Purpose of review: Nutritional status is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, directly or indirectly. Even with the recent rollout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and availability of medicines such as remdesivir, and monoclonal antibodies, host nutritional status is pivotal in the fight against the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and outcomes. The purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of COVID-19-related lockdown on lifestyle behaviors, and the nutritional consequences, and the direct sequelae of the infection on nutrition including potential nutritional interventions. Recent findings: The COVID-19-related lockdown imposed radical changes in lifestyle behaviors with considerable short-term and long-term health and nutritional consequences including weight gain and obesity and increased cardiometabolic risk, consistently linked to worsened prognosis. The extent of the impact was dependent on food insecurity, overall stress and disordered eating, physical inactivity, and exposure to COVID-19-related nutrition information sources. COVID-19 could directly induce inflammatory responses and poor nutrient intake and absorption leading to undernutrition with micronutrient deficiencies, which impairs immune system function with subsequent amplified risk of infection and disease severity. Nutrition interventions through nutrition support, dietary supplementation, and home remedies such as use of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids showed the most significant promise to mitigate the course of COVID-19 infection and improve survival rates. The nutrition-COVID-19 relationship and related dietary changes mimic a vicious cycle of the double burden of malnutrition, both obesity and undernutrition with micronutrient deficiencies, which promote infection, disease progression, and potential death.","Affiliations 1 Department of Agriculture, Nutrition and Human Ecology, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, TX, USA. jaantwi@pvamu.edu. 2 Department of Public Health, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA. 3 Department of Agriculture, Nutrition and Human Ecology, Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, TX, USA. 4 Wegmans School of Health and Nutrition, College of Health Sciences and Technology, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA.","Janet Antwi , Bernard Appiah , Busayo Oluwakuse , Brenda A Z Abu ",Curr Nutr Rep,2021 Dec,"Review,COVID-19*,Communicable Disease Control,Humans,Nutritional Status,Pandemics,SARS-CoV-2",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34837637
387,Current State of Evidence: Influence of Nutritional and Nutrigenetic Factors on Immunity in the COVID-19 Pandemic Framework,"The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis worldwide. Lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (COVID-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. The optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. Specifically, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) evaluated and deems six vitamins (D, A, C, Folate, B6, B12) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. In this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the COVID-19 pandemic context was carried out. First, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in COVID-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in PubMed and LitCovid databases. Second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 European countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological COVID-19 data (available in the Worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. Furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in Genome-Wide Association studies (GWAs) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. Therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by Ensembl) of individuals from European populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. Results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of Vitamin D and iron in the context of COVID-19. Besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients-especially Vitamins D, C, B12, and iron-are inversely associated with higher COVID-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. In conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Affiliations 1 Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Nutrition and Biotechnology, NUO Group, Universitat de les Illes Balears, 07122 Palma, Spain. 2 CIBER de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBEROBN), 28029 Madrid, Spain. 3 Institut d'Investigació Sanitària Illes Balears (IdISBa), 07120 Palma, Spain. 4 Alimentómica S.L., Spin-off n.1 of the University of the Balearic Islands, 07121 Palma, Spain.","Sebastià Galmés , Francisca Serra , Andreu Palou ",Nutrients,2020 Sep 8,"Review,Adolescent,Adult,Betacoronavirus,COVID-19,Coronavirus Infections* / epidemiology,Coronavirus Infections* / immunology,Coronavirus Infections* / physiopathology,Female,Genome-Wide Association Study,Humans,Male,Metals, Heavy / blood,Middle Aged,Nutrigenomics*,Nutritional Status* / genetics,Nutritional Status* / immunology,Nutritional Status* / physiology,Pandemics*,Pneumonia, Viral* / epidemiology,Pneumonia, Viral* / immunology,Pneumonia, Viral* / physiopathology,SARS-CoV-2,Selenium / blood,Vitamins / blood,Young Adult,Metals, Heavy,Vitamins,Selenium",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32911778
388,Parenting interventions to promote early child development in the first three years of life: A global systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Parents are the primary caregivers of young children. Responsive parent-child relationships and parental support for learning during the earliest years of life are crucial for promoting early child development (ECD). We conducted a global systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of parenting interventions on ECD and parenting outcomes. Methods and findings: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Global Health Library for peer-reviewed, published articles from database inception until November 15, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of parenting interventions delivered during the first 3 years of life that evaluated at least 1 ECD outcome. At least 2 reviewers independently screened, extracted data, and assessed study quality from eligible studies. ECD outcomes included cognitive, language, motor, and socioemotional development, behavior problems, and attachment. Parenting outcomes included parenting knowledge, parenting practices, parent-child interactions, and parental depressive symptoms. We calculated intervention effect sizes as the standardized mean difference (SMD) and estimated pooled effect sizes for each outcome separately using robust variance estimation meta-analytic approaches. We used random-effects meta-regression models to assess potential effect modification by country-income level, child age, intervention content, duration, delivery, setting, and study quality. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018092458 and CRD42018092461). Of the 11,920 articles identified, we included 111 articles representing 102 unique RCTs. Pooled effect sizes indicated positive benefits of parenting interventions on child cognitive development (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 0.23, 0.40, P < 0.001), language development (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37, P < 0.001), motor development (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.32, P < 0.001), socioemotional development (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.28, P < 0.001), and attachment (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.40, P < 0.001) and reductions in behavior problems (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.08, P < 0.001). Positive benefits were also found on parenting knowledge (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.79, P < 0.001), parenting practices (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.44, P < 0.001), and parent-child interactions (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.53, P < 0.001). However, there was no significant reduction in parental depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.16 to 0.02, P = 0.08). Subgroup analyses revealed significantly greater effects on child cognitive, language, and motor development, and parenting practices in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries; and significantly greater effects on child cognitive development, parenting knowledge, parenting practices, and parent-child interactions for programs that focused on responsive caregiving compared to those that did not. On the other hand, there was no clear evidence of effect modification by child age, intervention duration, delivery, setting, or study risk of bias. Study limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, inadequate reporting of intervention content and implementation, and varying quality of evidence in terms of the conduct of trials and robustness of outcome measures used across studies. Conclusions: Parenting interventions for children during the first 3 years of life are effective for improving ECD outcomes and enhancing parenting outcomes across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Increasing implementation of effective and high-quality parenting interventions is needed globally and at scale in order to support parents and enable young children to achieve their full developmental potential.","Affiliation 1 Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

389,"The benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, berberine and coptisine, act against camptothecin-resistant topoisomerase I mutants","DNA replication inhibitors are utilized extensively in studies of molecular biology and as chemotherapy agents in clinical settings. The inhibition of DNA replication often triggers double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) at stalled DNA replication sites, resulting in cytotoxicity. In East Asia, some traditional medicines are administered as anticancer drugs, although the mechanisms underlying their pharmacological effects are not entirely understood. In this study, we screened Japanese herbal medicines and identified two benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), berberine and coptisine. These alkaloids mildly induced DSBs, and this effect was dependent on the function of topoisomerase I (Topo I) and MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease. Biochemical analysis revealed that the action of BIAs involves inhibiting the catalytic activity of Topo I rather than inducing the accumulation of the Topo I-DNA complex, which is different from the action of camptothecin (CPT). Furthermore, the results showed that BIAs can act as inhibitors of Topo I, even against CPT-resistant mutants, and that the action of these BIAs was independent of CPT. These results suggest that using a combination of BIAs and CPT might increase their efficiency in eliminating cancer cells.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, 1-1 Idaigaoka, Hasama-machi, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan. 2 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Yufu, Japan. 3 Clinical Engineering Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, 1-1 Idaigaoka, Hasama-machi, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan. 4 Department of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. 5 Division of Structural Biology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. 6 Department of Clinical Biology Ant Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Yufu, Japan. 7 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Yufu, Japan. 8 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, 1-1 Idaigaoka, Hasama-machi, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan. ynishida@oita-u.ac.jp. 9 Clinical Engineering Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, 1-1 Idaigaoka, Hasama-machi, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan. hanada@oita-u.ac.jp.","Naomi Inoue # , Takeshi Terabayashi # , Yuri Takiguchi-Kawashima , Daisuke Fujinami , Shigeru Matsuoka , Masanori Kawano , Kazuhiro Tanaka , Hiroshi Tsumura , Toshimasa Ishizaki , Hisashi Narahara , Daisuke Kohda , Yoshihiro Nishida , Katsuhiro Hanada ",Sci Rep,2021 Apr 8,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic / pharmacology*,Berberine / analogs & derivatives*,Berberine / pharmacology*,Camptothecin / pharmacology*,Cell Line, Tumor,DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded / drug effects,DNA Replication / drug effects,DNA Topoisomerases, Type I / genetics,Drug Resistance, Neoplasm / drug effects*,Herbal Medicine,Humans,Topoisomerase I Inhibitors / pharmacology*,Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic,Topoisomerase I Inhibitors,coptisine,Berberine,DNA Topoisomerases, Type I,Camptothecin",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33833336
390,The Effects of Dietary Nutrition on Sleep and Sleep Disorders,"Sleep disorder significantly affects the life quality of a large number of people but is still an underrecognized disease. Dietary nutrition is believed to play a significant impact on sleeping wellness. Many nutritional supplements have been used trying to benefit sleep wellness. However, the relationship between nutritional components and sleep is complicated. Nutritional factors vary dramatically with different diet patterns and depend significantly on the digestive and metabiotic functions of each individual. Moreover, nutrition can profoundly affect the hormones and inflammation status which directly or indirectly contribute to insomnia. In this review, we summarized the role of major nutritional factors, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and vitamins on sleep and sleep disorders and discussed the potential mechanisms.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. 2 Department of Cardiology, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.","Mingxia Zhao , Houzhen Tuo , Shuhui Wang , Lin Zhao ",Mediators Inflamm,2020 Jun 25,"Review,Amino Acids / metabolism,Dietary Supplements*,Humans,Nutritional Status / physiology*,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Wake Disorders / diet therapy*,Sleep Wake Disorders / metabolism*,Amino Acids",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32684833
391,Mental Health Professionals' Perceptions of Parenting by Service Users with Psychosis,"Despite extensive needs, interventions for parents with psychosis are rarely offered, poorly described, and vary between offering instrumental and emotional support. To improve the design of interventions offered to families with parental psychosis, more knowledge is needed. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge about mental health professionals' perceptions of parenting by patients with psychosis. Eleven mental health professionals educated in family interventions were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide and the material underwent inductive thematic analysis. Results showed that the professionals described the patients parenting as characterized by difficulties in providing security and predictability, taking part in and organizing family life, and to focus on the child's needs. The difficulties were described as related to specific symptoms such as voice hearing, cognitive impairments, anxiety, and paranoia. As a vast amount of research stresses the psychosocial basis of psychosis and the interpersonal causes of its symptoms, parenting difficulties in people with psychosis could benefit from being addressed from a relational perspective. Accordingly, parents with psychosis should be offered interventions that enable them to create positive parental role models, develop reflective functioning, and identify situations in which their symptoms might hinder positive parenting. Many of these needs are unmet by interventions offered in adult psychosis services today.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Gothenburg, Box 500, 405 30, Göteborg, Sweden. jennifer.strand@psy.gu.se. 2 Gothenburg Research Institute, University of Gothenburg, Box 603, 405 30, Göteborg, Sweden.","Jennifer Strand , Lisa Rudolfsson ",Community Ment Health J,2020 Aug,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Child,Humans,Mental Health,Parenting*,Parents,Perception,Psychotic Disorders* / therapy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31925655

394,Thermoregulation and Sleep: Functional Interaction and Central Nervous Control,"Each of the wake-sleep states is characterized by specific changes in autonomic activity and bodily functions. The goal of such changes is not always clear. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the autonomic outflow and the activity of the endocrine system, the respiratory system, the cardiovascular system, and the thermoregulatory system seem to be directed at increasing energy saving. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the goal of the specific autonomic and regulatory changes is unclear, since a large instability of autonomic activity and cardiorespiratory function is observed in concomitance with thermoregulatory changes, which are apparently non-functional to thermal homeostasis. Reciprocally, the activation of thermoregulatory responses under thermal challenges interferes with sleep occurrence. Such a double-edged and reciprocal interaction between sleep and thermoregulation may be favored by the fact that the central network controlling sleep overlaps in several parts with the central network controlling thermoregulation. The understanding of the central mechanism behind the interaction between sleep and thermoregulation may help to understand the functionality of thermoregulatory sleep-related changes and, ultimately, the function(s) of sleep. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

Design: This is a cross-sectional study that determines the sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional habits, nutritional behaviour, nutritional literacy status of adolescents and affecting factors. Setting: Denizli, Turkey. Participants: We included 523 adolescents in ninth grade in this study. Results: Half (49·7 %) of the participants were female; 47 %, in normal BMI; and 68·1 %, non-smokers. The mean (sd) Adolescent Nutrition Literacy Scale score was 67·6 (sd 7·9).

396,Fetal reduction and twins,"Infertility treatments have allowed millions of couples to have their own children, but resultant multiple pregnancies with their increased morbidity and mortality have been a significant complication. Fetal reduction was developed to ameliorate this issue. Over 30 years of publications show that fetal reduction has been highly successful in substantially reducing both mortality and morbidity related to multiple pregnancies. As with most radically new techniques, initial cases were in the ""nothing to lose"" category. With experience, indications liberalize, and quality of life issues gain relevance. The overall risks of twin pregnancy are not twice that of singleton pregnancy; they are about 4 to 5 times higher. In experienced hands, the combination of genetic testing by chorionic villus sampling followed by fetal reduction has made the outcomes of most multiple pregnancies statistically equivalent to those of pregnancies with lower fetal numbers. Use of microarray analysis to better determine fetal genetic health before deciding on which fetus(es) to keep or reduce further improves pediatric outcomes. With increasing experience and lower average starting numbers, the proportion of fetal reductions to a singleton has increased considerably. Twins to a singleton fetal reductions now constitute an increasing proportion of cases performed. Data on such cases show improved outcomes, and we believe fetal reduction should be at least discussed and offered to all patients with a dichorionic twin pregnancy or higher. With the increasing reliance on elective single-embryo transfers, monochorionic twins, which have much higher complication rates than dichorionic twins, have increased substantially. Furthermore, monochorionic twins cannot be readily and safely reduced, so the adverse perinatal statistics of elective single-embryo transfer are a major setback for good outcomes. Although elective single-embryo transfer is appropriate for some, we believe that for many couples, the transfer of 2 embryos is generally a more rational approach.","Affiliations 1 Comprehensive Genetics, Fetal Medicine Foundation of America, New York, NY (Dr Evans, Ms Curtis, Ms Evans, and Dr Britt); Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY (Dr Evans).

397,Longitudinal psychometric evaluation of the developmental disorder parenting stressor index with Japanese parents of children with autism,"Parents of children with autism experience high rates of parenting stress. Assessing parenting stress in them has crucial clinical implications because increased parental stress is associated with psychological disorders and personal distress, which can result in worse child-parent relationships. Theorists have proposed that a person's cognitive appraisal determines whether or not a situation or an encounter is personally stressful. However, prior scales merely measure the outcomes of parental stress as a stress response: little the scales were designed to assess events and cognitive appraisal-related parenting stressors of parents of children with autism. We investigated whether a new index for assessing parenting stressors-the Developmental Disorder Parenting Stressor Index is a valid measure to assess parenting stressors of parents of children with autism using longitudinal online surveys at three times. Participants were 212 Japanese parents of children with autism aged 2-18 years who completed the Developmental Disorder Parenting Stressor Index and measures of autism symptoms and stress response . Overall, the findings indicated that the Developmental Disorder Parenting Stressor Index can be reliably used to measure both experiences and cognitive appraisal of parenting stressors among parents of children with autism. Moreover, the Developmental Disorder Parenting Stressor Index has several advantages and is a valuable measurement tool to be able to evaluate parenting stressors in clinical settings; Developmental Disorder Parenting Stressor Index is shorter, easier to complete, and can evaluate both viewpoints of parenting stressors.","Affiliation 1 Kobe University, Japan.",Takahiro Yamane ,Autism,2021 Oct,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Autism Spectrum Disorder*,Autistic Disorder*,Child,Developmental Disabilities,Humans,Japan,Parenting,Parents,Psychometrics,Stress, Psychological",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34378425

399,Parenting styles and preschool children's behaviour in a Saudi Arabian postgraduate dental setting,"Background: The parenting style is shifting universally. Children lack the skills needed to deal with life stressful situations like those present in dental setting. Previous studies showed a correlation between parenting style and the child's dental behaviour. No studies have been performed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to relate parenting style to child's dental behaviour. The purpose of this study is to correlate parenting styles with the dental behaviour of their children, in Riyadh, KSA. Methodology: Two hundred and eighty-two healthy preschool children aged 3-6 years were recruited in their first dental visit, to a postgraduate Paediatric Dentistry Clinics of the Dental University Hospital at KSU, Riyadh, KSA. The Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire was completed by the primary caregiver/parents. The behaviour of the children was evaluated after dental prophylaxis and fluoride application in the dental chair using Frankl behavior rating scale. Family and child demographic data were evaluated through a questionnaire. Results: Two hundred and eighty-two healthy Saudi children participated in the study with their parents. Two parenting styles were identified among Saudi parents including authoritative (94%, n = 265) and permissive parenting styles (6%, n = 17). Most of the children behaved positively (n = 205, 72.7%). Significant correlations were detected between parenting style and parent's dental anxiety (P value 0.02) but not significantly correlated to a child's dental behaviuor. Conclusion: In the KSU sample studied, two parenting styles were identified among Saudi parents, authoritative and permissive parenting styles. Parenting style was correlated to parental dental anxiety and had an influence on a child's dental behaviour. Clinically, interesting correlations were identified regarding factors affecting child/s first dental visit behaviour.","Affiliations 1 Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

400,Examining and Promoting Sleep Health in the Undergraduate Classroom: A Mixed-Methods Approach,"Objective: Although college students are at heightened risk for sleep disturbances, healthy sleep is associated with positive physical, cognitive, psychological, and academic benefits for this group. The goals of the current study were to (1) describe sleep health in an undergraduate college sample and (2) examine the role of a class activity using self-determination theory to promote better sleep health in this group. Methods: A cohort study was conducted using data drawn from class activities conducted in two undergraduate Introduction to Psychology courses. Students were undergraduates at a mid-Atlantic public university in the United States. Total sample size was N = 224 (intervention class [n = 98], and the control class [n = 127]). Both the intervention and control classes completed the RU SATED sleep health questionnaire at the beginning and the end of the semester. The intervention class also completed a self-determination activity focused on sleep health mid-semester. Both the RU SATED questionnaires and the self-determination activities were completed via in-class responder technology. Data were de-identified and downloaded from the responder technology at the end of the semester. Mixed methods were used for data analysis including quantitative analyses and a qualitative approach using a phenomenological, inductive, and reflexive qualitative method whereby themes were allowed to emerge from the data. Results: Overall, almost 25% of the students reported never or rarely obtaining healthy sleep on average. The majority (76%) said they sometimes have healthy sleep and no students reported usually or always obtaining healthy sleep. The components of sleep health the entire sample scored highest on were timing (sleeping between 2 and 4 AM), sleep duration (between 7 and 9 h), and staying awake during the day. The areas they scored the lowest on were maintaining regular bed and wake times, spending less than 30 min awake at night, and feeling satisfied with their sleep. Qualitatively, the most frequently obtained sleep health behaviors of the intervention class were rhythmicity, prioritizing sleep, timing of sleep, and tech hygiene. The intervention class had significantly better sleep health across the entire semester and significantly better daytime alertness post-intervention. The most commonly chosen sleep health behaviors to change were sleep hygiene, tech hygiene, and stimulus control. Conclusion: We examined the classroom environment as a venue for promoting sleep health among college students. Given the popularity of Introduction to Psychology courses, this class is a promising avenue to deliver sleep health promotions to a large number of students. The implementation of a self-determination framework, as part of sleep health promotion, shows potential for creating a person-centered, strengths-based approach to health behavior change within this population.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University, P.O.

401,Nutrition Periodization in Dancers,"Dancers' energy demands fluctuate across the season. Accordingly, dancers should adapt their training and nutrition. Still, how to periodize nutrition in dancers remains unclear. This article aims to (1) introduce nutrition periodization and (2) provide recommendations for nutrition periodization in dancers. During preseason, dancers design, rehearse, and train. During in-season, dancers have one or more daily performances. During postseason, dancers rest and prepare for the next season. Nutrition periodization is the strategic and timed nutrient intake to meet varying seasonal energy demands. Overall, nutrition periodization can support dancers' training goals, enhance their performance, and support optimal recovery.","Affiliations 1 Sports Medicine Assessment Research and Testing (SMART) Laboratory, George Mason University, 201-F, K Johnson Hall, MSN 4E5, 10890 George Mason Circle, Manassas, VA 20110, USA.

402,Racial Disparities in Emotional Well-Being during Pregnancy,"In light of persistent racial disparities in maternal and child health, it is important to understand the dynamics shaping outcomes for black mothers. We examine racial patterns in women's emotional well-being regarding pregnancy (i.e., women's reported happiness to be pregnant), which has been shown to have health consequences. Using the 2002-2017 National Survey of Family Growth (N = 6,163 pregnancies ending in birth), we find that black women are less happy about their pregnancies than white women both for intended and mistimed pregnancies. The happiness gap in intended pregnancies is partially attributable to differences in economic strain and partner support. In addition, child gender shapes happiness differently by race: Black women who previously had sons are unhappier about current intended pregnancies than those who did not (with no difference for white women). We argue there are pregnancy- and parenthood-related stressors that disproportionately impact black women, with potential implications for mothers and children.","Affiliation 1 University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA.","Caroline Sten Hartnett , Mia Brantley ",J Health Soc Behav,2020 Jun,"Adult,African Americans / psychology,African Americans / statistics & numerical data*,Emotions,Female,Happiness,Health Status Disparities*,Humans,Mental Health / statistics & numerical data*,Parenting,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unwanted / psychology,Pregnant Women / psychology*,Race Factors,Socioeconomic Factors,Whites / psychology,Whites / statistics & numerical data*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32447990
403,The effect of napping and nighttime sleep on memory in infants,"During the first year of life, infants devote the majority of their time to sleep. Research in adults has shown that sleep supports a variety of memory processes. Surprisingly, sleep's function for infant memory has only started to receive attention in research. In this chapter, we will describe age-related changes in sleep and in memory processing over the first years of life, as well as methods to capture both sleep and memory. Then, we will review current findings on the effects of sleep on memory processing in infants. Lastly, we will also point out gaps in current knowledge and describe potential avenues for future research. Overall, the results of recent experimental studies provide evidence that timely, extended napping is involved in how memories are encoded and stored in the long-term and contribute to the formation of knowledge networks in infants.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Psychology, Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, Mental Health Research and Treatment Center, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

404,Parenting stress in caregivers of young children with ASD concerns prior to a formal diagnosis,"Robust findings demonstrate that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high levels of parenting stress that are associated with negative outcomes for families. Although the majority of research on parenting stress has focused on parents of children with an existing diagnosis, parents of young children with concerns about ASD-related behaviors also face many unique challenges before the time of diagnosis. However, no study to date has examined patterns of parenting stress among parents of children with ASD concerns prior to a formal ASD diagnosis. Therefore, the current study investigated longitudinal trajectories of parenting stress among parents of young children with ASD concerns compared to parents of children with non-ASD developmental concerns (e.g., language delay), and parents of children with no developmental concerns. Known predictors of parenting stress were also examined. Results from multilevel model analyses revealed that parents of children with ASD concerns experienced consistently higher levels of parenting stress across early child development compared to parents of children with non-ASD developmental concerns and those with no concerns. Additionally, parenting efficacy, psychological functioning, social satisfaction, and child social communication behaviors predicted levels of parenting stress for all parents. Autism Res 2020, 13: 82-92. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: This study examined parenting stress across time among parents of young children with ASD concerns before receiving a diagnosis. Parents of children with ASD concerns reported consistently higher levels of parenting stress compared to parents of children with other developmental concerns and parents of children with no concerns. Also, ASD concerns predicted parenting stress in addition to other parent and child predictors of parenting stress. These findings highlight the need to better support families before an ASD diagnosis.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.","Trent D DesChamps , Lisa V Ibañez , Sarah R Edmunds , Catherine C Dick , Wendy L Stone ",Autism Res,2020 Jan,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Adult,Autism Spectrum Disorder / psychology*,Caregivers / psychology*,Caregivers / statistics & numerical data,Child Behavior / psychology*,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Middle Aged,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Stress, Psychological / psychology*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31593362
405,Evaluation of a College-Level Nutrition Course With a Teaching Kitchen Lab,"Objective: To evaluate the impact of a college nutrition course with a teaching kitchen lab on students' attitudes, self-efficacy, and behaviors about healthful eating and cooking. Methods: Preintervention and postintervention design, and anonymous online survey of sociodemographic information and students' attitudes and self-efficacy about consuming fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and about cooking, self-reported intake, and cooking behaviors. Results: Two-hundred and fourteen participants enrolled in the study during 5 semesters. Of these, 171 (80%) had complete pretest and posttest data. Attitudes and self-efficacy scores about consuming fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and cooking were significantly higher in the posttest (vs pretest; all P < 0.0001). Self-reported intake of fruits (P < 0.0001) and vegetables (P = 0.0006) also increased. Cooking frequency increased (P < 0.0001), skipping meals frequency decreased (P < 0.0001), whereas no significant changes were observed for eating out, take-out, or premade meals frequency. Conclusions and implications: A college nutrition course with a teaching kitchen lab could improve healthful eating and promote cooking in young adults.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA.

406,Desloratadine Use During Pregnancy and Risk of Adverse Fetal Outcomes: A Nationwide Cohort Study,"Background: Desloratadine is a frequently used drug for the treatment of allergic disorders, which often also require treatment during pregnancy. However, information on the fetal safety of desloratadine use during pregnancy is limited. Objective: To investigate the association between desloratadine use during pregnancy and adverse fetal outcomes. Methods: From a cohort of 1,287,668 pregnancies identified in the Danish nationwide registries in the study period 2001 to 2016, users of desloratadine and loratadine during pregnancy were matched in a 1:1 ratio based on propensity scores to compare the risk of adverse fetal outcomes. We compared the risk of the primary outcomes major birth defects (among a total of 3348 pregnancies) and spontaneous abortion (5498 pregnancies) and the secondary outcomes preterm birth (5280 pregnancies), small size for gestational age (SGA) for birth weight (5436 pregnancies), and stillbirth (6776 pregnancies). Logistic regression was used to estimate the prevalence odds ratio (OR) of major birth defects, preterm birth, and SGA, and Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. Sensitivity analyses included comparing with cetirizine use in pregnancy and with pregnancies unexposed to desloratadine but with prior use as additional comparator groups. Results: Use of desloratadine in pregnancy was not associated with a significant increased risk of major birth defects (prevalence OR, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.50), spontaneous abortion (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.96-1.37), preterm birth (prevalence OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05), SGA (prevalence OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.16), or stillbirth (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.31-2.70) compared with loratadine use in pregnancy. Sensitivity analyses, including those with the use of additional comparator groups, showed similar results. Conclusion: Use of desloratadine during pregnancy was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes as compared with loratadine. Results indicate that the fetal safety profile of desloratadine is similar to the currently recommended second-generation antihistamines during pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Copenhagen NV, Denmark; Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen S, Denmark.

407,Medicinal Plants in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Review,"Background: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling mental disorder encountered in neurologic practice. In spite of the several classes of drugs that are available for the treatment of OCD, full remission remains challenging. Research on herbal remedies has grown over the last decade. Objective: This present review article provides information regarding the plants that exhibited protective effects on OCD. Methods: To retrieve articles related to the study, Web of Science, PubMed (NLM), Open Access Journals, LISTA (EBSCO), and Google Scholar, with keywords including Medicinal plants, Psychiatric disorders, Obsessive-compulsive disorder and Phytomedicine were used. Results: The plants which are used for the treatment of OCD are: Citrus aurantium, Crocus sativus, Benincasa hispida, Withania somnifera, Colocasia esculenta, Hypericum perforatum, Valeriana officinalis, Lagenaria siceraria and Echium amoenum. Conclusion: This review suggests that some medicinal plants can be potential drug candidates for the treatment of OCD. Aside from this, the future focus should be on the standardization of herbal extracts, and further research is required to be performed on the concept of mechanism. Clinical research in this area is in its infancy and warrants further clinical research.","Affiliations 1 Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. 2 Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. 3 Psychiatric Research Center, Roozbeh Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.","Ali Talaei , Fatemeh Forouzanfar , Shahin Akhondzadeh ",Curr Drug Discov Technol,2021,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Drug Discovery,Herbal Medicine*,Humans,Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder / drug therapy*,Plant Extracts / pharmacology*,Plants, Medicinal / classification*,Plant Extracts",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31660838
408,Emotional reactivity and parenting in families experiencing homelessness,"Parents are key protective systems in the lives of children experiencing homelessness. Evidence suggests that parent emotional reactivity, expression, and regulation play a critical role in promoting adaptive parenting behaviors. Studies of emotional reactivity in parents utilize different methods, including self-report, observations, and physiological measures. However, these methods are rarely evaluated together, particularly among disadvantaged families. The present study examined how subjective (i.e., self-report), observed, and physiological measures of parent emotional reactivity relate to each other and to observed parenting behaviors in problem-solving and teaching parent-child interaction tasks. Participants included fifty 4- to 7-year-old children and their caregivers staying in an emergency homeless shelter. Observed and subjective emotional reactivity were largely uncorrelated, except for positive emotions during problem-solving tasks. Adaptive parenting behavior was related to lower scores on measures of subjective and observed negative emotions and higher observed scores for positive emotions during problem-solving tasks, as well as higher observed scores of positive emotions during teaching tasks. Physiological reactivity was not related to parenting behaviors. Results suggest that associations of emotional reactivity with parenting behavior depend on the context of the parent-child interaction and how emotional reactivity is measured.

409,Parental hostility predicts reduced cortical thickness in males,"Although impacts of negative parenting on children's brain development are well-documented, little is known about how these associations may differ for males and females in childhood. We examined interactions between child sex and early and concurrent parental hostility on children's cortical thickness and surface area. Participants included 63 children (50.8% female) assessed during early childhood (Wave 1: M age = 4.23 years, SD = 0.84) and again three years later (Wave 2: M age = 7.19 years, SD = 0.89) using an observational parent-child interaction task. At Wave 2, children completed a structural MRI scan. Analyses focused on regions of interest. After correcting for multiple comparisons, Wave 1 parental hostility predicted males' reduced thickness in middle frontal and fusiform cortices, and Wave 2 parental hostility was concurrently associated with males' reduced thickness in the middle frontal cortex. Interactions between sex and parenting on children's surface area did not survive corrections for multiple comparisons. Our findings provide support for a male-specific neural vulnerability of hostile parenting across development. Results have important implications for uncovering neural pathways to sex-differences in psychopathology, learning, and cognitive disabilities.","Affiliation 1 University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA.","Emma Chad-Friedman , Morgan Botdorf , Tracy Riggins , Lea R Dougherty ",Dev Sci,2021 May,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Hostility*,Humans,Male,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33091205
410,Place of birth for unintended pregnancies in six former Soviet Union countries,"Objective: This paper aims at exploring the association between unintended pregnancies and place of birth in six Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries. Material and methods: A secondary analysis of the latest cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys of six FSU countries from 2005 through 2012 was conducted. Prevalence of institutional births and unintended pregnancies was estimated by country and for the pooled population. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to measure the country and pooled association between pregnancy intention and institutional birth. Results: Institutional births occurred in 90.4% of the overall study population and ranged from 78.2% in Tajikistan to 99.7% in Ukraine Demographic and Health Survey. Around one out of 10 pregnancies resulted unintended. In the pooled analysis, unintended pregnancies were significantly associated with giving births outside health facility (aOR1.2; 95% CI 1.0-1.6). Conclusion: Based on the study findings we suggest that increase awareness of benefit of skilled delivery care is needed among women with poor access to family planning.","Affiliations 1 Medical Epidemiologist, Independent Consultants, Geneva, Switzerland. 2 Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Microbiology Unit, Kingston Upon Thames, UK. 3 Infectious Diseases Department, AOU Sassari, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy. 4 Unità Operativa di Anestesia e Rianimazione, Ospedale ""S.S Annunziata"" Sassari, Sassari, Italy. 5 Italian Association for Solidarity among People (AISPO), Port Said, Egypt. 6 ISGlobal, Hospital Clinic - Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. 7 Centro de Investigacao em Saude de Manhica (CISM), Manhica, Maputo, Mozambique. 8 ICREA, Pg.

Twin pregnancy is characterized by greater maternal hemodynamic changes than a singleton pregnancy. Methods: In a study on 121 pregnant women in the last trimester we performed ICG, evaluating the following hemodynamic parameters: stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, ventricular ejection time, left ventricular ejection time, thoracic impedance, and systemic vascular resistance. Results: The study included singleton and twin pregnancies. Heart rate values in women with single fetus was lower than in those carrying twins (85 vs. 100 beats/min, p=0.021) as were the stroke volume values (64 vs. 83 mL, p=0.010) and the cardiac output (p<0.0001). Systemic vascular resistance decreased in twin pregnancies compared to singleton pregnancy (p=0.023). Conclusions: ICG studies are rare, and the validation of their results is an ongoing process. However, the ICG technique is applicable in the third trimester of pregnancy and can yield important information regarding the hemodynamic profile of singleton and twin pregnancies, revealing maternal heart changes specific to twin pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 The ""Carol Davila"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania. 2 The ""Bucur"" Maternity, ""Saint John"" Hospital, Bucharest, Romania. 3 Department for Gynecology, Obstetrics and Reproductive Medicine, Saarland University Hospital Homburg, Homburg, Germany. 4 Fertility Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.","Romina-Marina Sima , Sebastian Findeklee , Ioana-Anca Bădărău , Mircea-Octavian Poenaru , Cristian Scheau , Liana Pleș ",J Perinat Med,2021 Feb 11,"Adult,Cardiography, Impedance* / methods,Cardiography, Impedance* / statistics & numerical data,Correlation of Data,Female,Heart Rate,Hemodynamics / physiology*,Humans,Pregnancy / physiology*,Pregnancy Trimester, Third / physiology*,Pregnancy, Twin / physiology*,Reproducibility of Results,Stroke Volume,Vascular Resistance",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33567181
413,The Efficacy of Internet-Based Parenting Programs for Children and Adolescents with Behavior Problems: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials,"Online parenting programs can increase the accessibility of mental health services. This meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of online parenting interventions in reducing children and adolescents behavior problems (primary outcome) and improving parenting behavior, parent distress, and parenting efficacy (secondary outcomes). A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and ProQuest on June 28th, 2019. The meta-analysis was prior registered in PROSPERO. In total, 2160 records were identified and 15 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included (N = 1668) in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The quality of each study was assessed by two independent evaluators. When compared to waitlist, online parenting interventions are effective in reducing behavior problems with a small effect size (Hedges's g = 0.40). No significant differences were found between online and classical delivered parenting interventions in reducing behavior problems (g = - 0.07). Compared to waitlist, the interventions are effective in improving parenting behavior (g = 0.34), parent distress (g = 0.30), and parenting efficacy (g = 0.41). The results appear to be stable at follow-up measures. The factors responsible for the effectiveness of the interventions were explored through moderation analyses. Online parenting interventions are promising for improving both behavior problems and parent outcomes. Future studies should focus on methods to increase their effectiveness and measure the outcomes more objectively.","Affiliations 1 International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health, Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 2 Evidence Based Psychological Assessment and Interventions Doctoral School, Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 3 International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health, Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. ancadobrean@psychology.ro. 4 Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Babeş-Bolyai University, Republicii Street 37, 400015, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. ancadobrean@psychology.ro. 5 Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Babeş-Bolyai University, Republicii Street 37, 400015, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.","Ionuț Stelian Florean , Anca Dobrean , Costina Ruxandra Păsărelu , Raluca Diana Georgescu , Ion Milea ",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,2020 Dec,"Meta-Analysis,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Adolescent,Child,Child Behavior Disorders / therapy*,Education, Distance / methods,Humans,Parenting* / psychology,Parents / education,Parents / psychology,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32897527
414,Nutritional Orthopedics and Space Nutrition as Two Sides of the Same Coin: A Scoping Review,"Since the Moon landing, nutritional research has been charged with the task of guaranteeing human health in space. In addition, nutrition applied to Orthopedics has developed in recent years, driven by the need to improve the efficiency of the treatment path by enhancing the recovery after surgery. As a result, nutritional sciences have specialized into two distinct fields of research: Nutritional Orthopedics and Space Nutrition. The former primarily deals with the nutritional requirements of old patients in hospitals, whereas the latter focuses on the varied food challenges of space travelers heading to deep space. Although they may seem disconnected, they both investigate similar nutritional issues. This scoping review shows what these two disciplines have in common, highlighting the mutual features between (1) pre-operative vs. pre-launch nutritional programs, (2) hospital-based vs. space station nutritional issues, and (3) post-discharge vs. deep space nutritional resilience. PubMed and Google Scholar were used to collect documents published from 1950 to 2020, from which 44 references were selected on Nutritional Orthopedics and 44 on Space Nutrition. Both the orthopedic patient and the astronaut were found to suffer from food insecurity, malnutrition, musculoskeletal involution, flavor/pleasure issues, fluid shifts, metabolic stresses, and isolation/confinement. Both fields of research aid the planning of demand-driven food systems and advanced nutritional approaches, like tailored diets with nutrients of interest (e.g., vitamin D and calcium). The nutritional features of orthopedic patients on Earth and of astronauts in space are undeniably related. Consequently, it is important to initiate close collaborations between orthopedic nutritionists and space experts, with the musculoskeletal-related dedications playing as common fuel.","Affiliation 1 IRCCS Orthopedic Institute Galeazzi, Scientific Direction, Via Riccardo Galeazzi 4, 20161 Milano, Italy.",Matteo Briguglio ,Nutrients,2021 Feb 1,"Review,Aftercare,Animals,Astronauts,Bone and Bones,Calcium,Databases, Factual,Diet,Diet, Healthy,Dietary Supplements,Food,Gravitation,Humans,Malnutrition,Nutrients,Nutritional Requirements,Nutritional Status*,Orthopedics*,Patient Discharge,Sarcopenia,Space Flight*,Vitamin D,Vitamin D,Calcium",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33535596
415,"Stress, sleep, and autonomic function in healthy adolescent girls and boys: Findings from the NCANDA study","Objectives: Starting in adolescence, female sex is a strong risk factor for the development of insomnia. Reasons for this are unclear but could involve altered stress reactivity and/or autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation, which are strongly associated with the pathophysiology of insomnia. We investigated sex differences in the effect of stress on sleep and ANS activity in adolescents, using the first night in the laboratory as an experimental sleep-related stressor. Design: Repeated measures (first night vs. a subsequent night) with age (older/younger) and sex (males/females) as between factors. Setting: Recordings were performed at the human sleep laboratory at SRI International. Participants: One hundred six healthy adolescents (Age, mean ± SD: 15.2 ± 2.0 years; 57 boys). Measures: Polysomnographic sleep, nocturnal heart rate (HR), and frequency-domain spectral ANS HR variability (HRV) indices. Results: Boys and girls showed a first-night effect, characterized by lower sleep efficiency, lower %N1 and %N2 sleep, more wake after sleep onset and %N3 sleep, altered sleep microstructure (increased high-frequency sigma and Beta1 electroencephalographic activity), and reduced vagal activity (P < .05) on the first laboratory night compared to a subsequent night. The first night ANS stress effect (increases in HR and suppression in vagal HRV during rapid eye movement sleep) was greater in girls than boys (P < .05). Conclusions: Sleep and ANS activity were altered during the first laboratory night in adolescents, with girls exhibiting greater ANS alterations than boys. Findings suggest that girls may be more vulnerable than boys to sleep-specific stressors, which could contribute to their increased risk for developing stress-related sleep disturbances.","Affiliations 1 Center for Health Sciences, SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA. 2 Center for Health Sciences, SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA; Brain Function Research Group, School of Physiology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. 3 Center for Health Sciences, SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA; Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. 4 Center for Health Sciences, SRI International, Menlo Park, California, USA.

Recent findings: Reviews in singleton gestations show that weight gain below the recommended guidelines has been associated with small for gestational age infants (less than the 10th percentile) which place these infants at increased risk for neonatal morbidities. Observational studies have shown that adequate and excessive gestational weight gain in twin gestations has been associated with longer gestations and less preterm birth along with increased birth weight at delivery. Weight gain in pregnancy has been identified as a factor that affects both maternal and infant health outcomes in singleton and twin gestations. There is a larger body of research examining these effects in singleton gestations than twin gestations; however, in both groups, the data remain mostly observational and retrospective. Thus far, the research supports the Institute of Medicine recommended weight gain guidelines in singleton and twin gestations for women with normal BMI, but future research should be directed toward underweight and overweight women and the long-term outcomes in all mothers and their offspring.","Affiliation 1 Baylor College of Medicine, 6651 Main St, Suite 1096, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. manishag@bcm.edu.",Manisha Gandhi ,Curr Nutr Rep,2020 Jun,"Review,Basal Metabolism,Birth Weight,Body Mass Index,Female,Gestational Weight Gain*,Guidelines as Topic*,Humans,Pregnancy / metabolism*,Pregnancy / physiology*,Pregnancy Outcome",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32483691
417,Postsecondary nutrition program education in the hashemite Kingdom of Jordan: A brief report,"Background: Obesity is a growing public health concern in Jordan, which has experienced a noticeable transition associated with increased morbidity and mortality, due to nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases. The nutrition profession has also advanced in Jordan, but the expansion is not as robust as changes happening in other healthcare sectors. This brief report examines the current nutrition-affiliated programs offered in postsecondary institutions in Jordan. Methods: An electronic review of university websites and department webpages of all private and public universities in Jordan was conducted to identify the nutrition programs offered. Results: A total of 29 universities were identified; 10 public and 19 private universities. Eight universities (three private and five public) offered nutrition degree programs; all eight offered bachelor's degrees in human nutrition. One offered a PhD in nutrition and dietetics, and three offered master's degrees in nutrition and food sciences. Discussion: Postsecondary education in Jordan is progressing; however, few institutions offered nutrition education programs that prepare students to practice. The nutrition profession still lacks an official organization in Jordan compared to its European and U.S. counterparts. Establishment of a nutrition and dietetics organization that cooperates with universities to develop national recognitions and guidelines is necessary.","Affiliations 1 Applied Nutrition Graduate Program, College of Professional Studies, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA. 2 Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, College of Professional Studies, Northeastern University, Pediatric Critical Care Nutrition, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. 3 Doctor of Education in Health Professions Department, A.T.

418,"Post-Traumatic Stress, Mother's Emotion Regulation, and Parenting in Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence","Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are high among female survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), and children of parents experiencing PTSS are at heightened risk for a wide range of emotional and behavioral problems. Parenting has significant influence on child adjustment, and although links have been found between parental psychopathology and maladaptive parenting, little is known about the factors that may explain this relation. The current study examines mother's emotion regulation (ER) as a factor influencing the relation between mother PTSS and parenting around children's emotions in a study sample of sixty-four female survivors of IPV and their 6- to 12-year-old children. Mothers reported on their own PTSS and their parenting. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was used as a psychophysiological index of mother's ER. Experiential components of mother's ER was also measured by observer coding of the Meta-Emotion Interview, a structured assessment that asks parents about their attitudes toward and experiences with emotions, including their regulation of emotions. Mother's RSA reactivity moderated the relation between PTSS and negative parenting. There was also a significant indirect relation between mothers' PTSS symptom severity and supportive parenting reactions through mothers' self-report of ER. Results suggest that mother's ER abilities represent factors that significantly affect associations between maternal PTSS and parent's emotion socialization practices. Implications for assessment and intervention with families exposed to the stress of IPV are discussed.","Affiliation 1 University of Washington, Seattle, USA.","Kyrill Gurtovenko , Lynn Fainsilber Katz ",J Interpers Violence,2020 Feb,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Child,Emotional Regulation*,Female,Humans,Intimate Partner Violence / psychology*,Male,Mother-Child Relations,Mothers / psychology*,Parenting / psychology*,Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic / psychology*,Survivors / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29294652

420,Risk factors of unsuccessful vaginal twin delivery,"Introduction: Twin trial of labor presents a challenge to obstetricians, as it is associated with a greater number of adverse birth outcomes compared with singleton deliveries. The risk of poor outcome has shown to be highest with unsuccessful vaginal twin delivery. The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical risk factors associated with intrapartum cesarean section in late preterm and term twin births. Material and methods: All live diamniotic twin deliveries of at least 35+0 weeks of gestation with planned vaginal delivery were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. Maternal and newborn characteristics were compared between a vaginal delivery group and an intrapartum cesarean section group. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine independent risk factors of intrapartum cesarean section. Further, maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between groups of vaginal delivery and cesarean section for both twins and also between groups of vaginal delivery and cesarean section for the second twin only (combined delivery). The impact of presentation of the second twin on the mode of twin delivery and on neonatal outcome was also examined. Results: Among 821 twin pregnancies, 581 mothers (70.8%) attempted trial of labor and were eligible for the study. With a cephalic-presenting first twin, the trial of labor rate was 89.3% and vaginal delivery was successful in 82.8%. Nulliparity (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-5.1) and non-cephalic presentation of the second twin (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.8) were found to be independent risk factors of cesarean section. However, 76.1% of mothers with non-cephalic second twins achieved vaginal delivery and perinatal outcomes were comparable with cases of cephalic-presenting second twins. When comparing delivery modes, maternal outcomes were more favorable with vaginal delivery, whereas combined delivery increased the second twin's risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Conclusions: This study, with high rates of trial of labor and successful vaginal twin delivery, found nulliparity and non-cephalic presentation of the second twin to be risk factors of intrapartum cesarean section in twin pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland. 2 Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland. 3 Faculty of Social Sciences, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.","Elina Ylilehto , Outi Palomäki , Heini Huhtala , Jukka Uotila ",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,2020 Nov,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cesarean Section*,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Labor Presentation,Logistic Models,Outcome Assessment, Health Care,Parity,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin*,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Trial of Labor*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32415979
421,Parental Licensing as Harm Reduction,"In this paper, I will argue that some prominent objections to parental licensing rely on dubious claims about the existence of a very stringent, if not indefeasible, right to parent, which would be violated by licensing. I claim that attaching such stringency to the right only makes sense if we make a number of idealising assumptions. Otherwise, it is deeply implausible. Instead, I argue that we should evaluate parental licensing policies in much the same way we would harm reduction policies. By adopting this critical perspective, we can see that there are powerful, but quite different, reasons to be cautious about parental licensing relating to our ability to minimize the harmful effects of mass-parenting in a world of minimal surveillance and intervention.","Affiliation 1 University of Manchester, 4.027, Arthur Lewis Building, Oxford Road, Manchester, M139PL, UK. liam.shields@manchester.ac.uk.",Liam Shields ,Health Care Anal,2020 Dec,"Child,Child Welfare*,Harm Reduction*,Human Rights,Humans,Licensure*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070225
422,Pregnant women do not display impaired memory formation across one night of sleep,"Forgetfulness is a common complaint of pregnant women, who also often report impaired nocturnal sleep. Considering sleep's well-known beneficial role in consolidating newly encoded memory content, we hypothesized that pregnant women would display detrimental changes in objective sleep measures and associated memory deficits. We compared the consolidation of declarative as well as procedural memory across sleep in 21 healthy, third-trimester pregnant women versus 20 matched non-pregnant controls. Subjects encoded and were tested on visuospatial and procedural memory tasks before and after, respectively, a night of sleep spent at home. The emergence of gist-based memories was tested with the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was polysomnographically recorded and subjective sleep quality was assessed with questionnaires. Although pregnant in comparison to non-pregnant women reported markedly impaired subjective sleep quality and efficiency, quantitative changes were limited to increases in wakefulness after sleep onset and reductions in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Retention of newly learned memory contents, which is believed to reflect sleep-associated memory consolidation, was comparable between groups, as was the formation of gist-based memories. The findings indicate that subjective deteriorations in sleep quality experienced by pregnant women are not necessarily linked to objective impairments. They raise the possibility that sufficient slow wave sleep towards the end of pregnancy allows for normal sleep-related memory consolidation. Although these results were obtained in a small number of pregnant women in very good health and should be corroborated in larger samples, they challenge the assumption of poor sleep and impaired memory as hallmarks of the ""pregnancy brain"".","Affiliations 1 Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioural Neurobiology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. 2 German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Tübingen, Germany. 3 Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases, Helmholtz Center Munich at the University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. 4 Division of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. 5 Department of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Interfaculty Centre for Pharmacogenomics and Pharma Research, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.","Katharina Zinke , Vanessa Lehnert , Andreas Fritsche , Hubert Preissl , Manfred Hallschmid ",J Sleep Res,2021 Jun,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Female,Humans,Memory Disorders / physiopathology*,Pregnancy,Pregnant Women,Sleep / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32985760

424,Enjoy Carefully: The Multifaceted Role of Vitamin E in Neuro-Nutrition,"Vitamin E is often associated with health benefits, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering effects. These properties make its supplementation a suitable therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative disorders, for example, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. However, trials evaluating the effects of vitamin E supplementation are inconsistent. In randomized controlled trials, the observed associations often cannot be substantiated. This could be due to the wide variety of study designs regarding the dosage and duration of vitamin E supplementation. Furthermore, genetic variants can influence vitamin E uptake and/or metabolism, thereby distorting its overall effect. Recent studies also show adverse effects of vitamin E supplementation regarding Alzheimer's disease due to the increased synthesis of amyloid β. These diverse effects may underline the inhomogeneous outcomes associated with its supplementation and argue for a more thoughtful usage of vitamin E. Specifically, the genetic and nutritional profile should be taken into consideration to identify suitable candidates who will benefit from supplementation. In this review, we will provide an overview of the current knowledge of vitamin E supplementation in neurodegenerative disease and give an outlook on individualized, sustainable neuro-nutrition, with a focus on vitamin E supplementation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany. 2 Department of Neurology, Klinikum Osnabrück, Am Finkenhügel 1, 49076 Osnabrück, Germany. 3 Department of Neurology with Institute of Translational Neurology, University Hospital Münster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Münster, Germany.","Liesa Regner-Nelke , Christopher Nelke , Christina B Schroeter , Rainer Dziewas , Tobias Warnecke , Tobias Ruck , Sven G Meuth ",Int J Mol Sci,2021 Sep 18,"Review,Alzheimer Disease / metabolism,Amyloid beta-Peptides / chemistry,Animals,Anti-Inflammatory Agents / pharmacology,Antioxidants,Cholesterol / chemistry,Dietary Supplements,Genetic Variation,Humans,Mice,Neurodegenerative Diseases / genetics*,Neurodegenerative Diseases / metabolism*,Nutritional Sciences*,Nutritional Status*,Rats,Vitamin E / chemistry*,Amyloid beta-Peptides,Anti-Inflammatory Agents,Antioxidants,Vitamin E,Cholesterol",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34576251
425,Discordance in parents' and adolescents' reports of parenting: A meta-analysis and qualitative review,"Parents and adolescents often provide discordant reports on parenting. Prior studies are inconsistent regarding the extent, predictors, and consequences of such discordance. The current study aimed to robustly estimate the extent, potential moderators, and consequences of discordance between parent- and adolescent-reported parenting by (a) meta-analyzing a large number of studies involving both parent- and adolescent-reported parenting (n = 313) and (b) qualitatively summarizing the main methods and findings in studies examining how parent-adolescent discordance in reports of parenting relates to adolescent outcomes (n = 36). The meta-analysis demonstrated a small yet statistically significant correlation between parent- and adolescent-reported parenting (r = .276; 95% confidence interval [CI: .262, .290]); parents perceived parenting more positively than did adolescents, with a small but statistically significant mean-level difference (g = .242; 95% CI [.188, .296]). The levels of parent-adolescent discordance were higher for younger (vs. older) and male (vs. female) adolescents; for nonclinical parents (vs. parents with internalizing symptoms); in more individualistic societies such as the United States; and in ethnic minority (vs. White), low (vs. high) socioeconomic status, and nonintact (vs. intact) families among U.S. samples. The qualitative review highlighted current methodological approaches, main findings, and limitations and strengths of each approach. Together, the two components of the current study have important implications for research and clinical practice, including areas of inquiry for future studies and how researchers and clinicians should handle informant discordance.

426,Perspectives of nurturance within the parent-child relationship in resource-constrained families,"Background: Nurturing parents raise children in an engaged, flexible, emotionally expressive and supportive manner, which is associated with positive outcomes for children. While parenting research within the South African context is increasing, there is a lack of focus on nurturance within the parent-child relationship. Thus, this study sought to explore how parents nurture their children in resource-constrained environments in South Africa. Method: A qualitative approach with an exploratory research design was used. Participants were purposively recruited via non-governmental institutions and key informants in the communities. A sample of 77 semi-structured interviews was conducted with participants from two rural areas, Calvinia and Lamberts Bay, in South Africa. Results: A thematic analysis of the data revealed two themes. The first theme is nurturance approaches, which encapsulate how parents nurture their children physically and emotionally. The second theme focuses on factors contributing to nurturance within the parent-child relationship with regard to parenting practices and external factors. Conclusion: Although parents are nurturing children physically and emotionally, parenting capacity needs to be improved in the South African context.","Affiliation 1 Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of Children, Families and Society, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa.","Tessa Goldschmidt , Lisa Petersen , Shakierah Booley , Nicolette V Roman ",Child Care Health Dev,2021 Jul,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Child Rearing,Humans,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting*,Parents,Social Behavior",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33638196
427,Monochorionic twins after in-vitro fertilization: do they have poorer outcomes?,"Objective: To compare the outcome of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies conceived by in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with that of spontaneously conceived MCDA twins. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of MCDA twin pregnancies conceived after IVF/ICSI or spontaneously, followed from the first trimester onwards at a single center between January 2002 and September 2018. The primary outcome was survival per fetus from the first trimester until 28 days after birth. Secondary outcome measures were number of survivors, miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, intrauterine and neonatal death, major congenital anomalies, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective fetal growth restriction, gestational age at birth, delivery before 32 weeks' gestation, mode of delivery, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, birth weight and birth-weight discordance. Results: Of the 654 MCDA pregnancies included in the analysis, 80 were conceived by IVF/ICSI and 574 spontaneously. Overall fetal and neonatal survival was significantly lower in the IVF/ICSI group than in the spontaneous-conception group (79% vs 90%; P = 0.001). In the IVF/ICSI group, compared with the spontaneous-conception group, loss of one or both twins occurred twice as often (29% vs 14%; P = 0.001) and there was a higher risk of second-trimester miscarriage (8% vs 1%; P = 0.002). Conclusions: MCDA twins conceived after IVF/ICSI have lower overall survival rates and higher rates of second-trimester miscarriage than do spontaneously conceived MCDA twins. Copyright © 2020 ISUOG.

429,Vegan Diet and Bone Health-Results from the Cross-Sectional RBVD Study,"Scientific evidence suggests that a vegan diet might be associated with impaired bone health. Therefore, a cross-sectional study (n = 36 vegans, n = 36 omnivores) was used to investigate the associations of veganism with calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurements, along with the investigation of differences in the concentrations of nutrition- and bone-related biomarkers between vegans and omnivores. This study revealed lower levels in the QUS parameters in vegans compared to omnivores, e.g., broadband ultrasound attenuation (vegans: 111.8 ± 10.7 dB/MHz, omnivores: 118.0 ± 10.8 dB/MHz, p = 0.02). Vegans had lower levels of vitamin A, B2, lysine, zinc, selenoprotein P, n-3 fatty acids, urinary iodine, and calcium levels, while the concentrations of vitamin K1, folate, and glutamine were higher in vegans compared to omnivores. Applying a reduced rank regression, 12 out of the 28 biomarkers were identified to contribute most to bone health, i.e., lysine, urinary iodine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, selenoprotein P, vitamin A, leucine, α-klotho, n-3 fatty acids, urinary calcium/magnesium, vitamin B6, and FGF23. All QUS parameters increased across the tertiles of the pattern score. The study provides evidence of lower bone health in vegans compared to omnivores, additionally revealing a combination of nutrition-related biomarkers, which may contribute to bone health. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Affiliations 1 Department of Food Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, 10589 Berlin, Germany. 2 Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charité, Universitätsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany. 3 Institute for Agricultural and Nutritional Sciences, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle (Saale), Germany. 4 Section for Pharmacology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway. 5 Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Saarland University Hospital, 66421 Homburg, Germany. 6 Department of Molecular Epidemiology, German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke, 14558 Nuthetal, Germany. 7 Institute of Nutritional Science, University of Potsdam, 14558 Nuthetal, Germany. 8 Laboratory of Human Nutrition, Institute of Food, Nutrition and Health, ETH Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland. 9 German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, 10589 Berlin, Germany. 10 Department of Food Chemistry, Institute of Nutritional Science, University of Potsdam, 14558 Nuthetal, Germany.","Juliane Menzel , Klaus Abraham , Gabriele I Stangl , Per Magne Ueland , Rima Obeid , Matthias B Schulze , Isabelle Herter-Aeberli , Tanja Schwerdtle , Cornelia Weikert ",Nutrients,2021 Feb 21,"Adult,Biomarkers / analysis,Body Mass Index,Bone Density*,Calcaneus / diagnostic imaging,Cross-Sectional Studies,Diet, Vegan / adverse effects*,Female,Fibroblast Growth Factor-23,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Nutritional Status / physiology*,Ultrasonography,Biomarkers,FGF23 protein, human,Fibroblast Growth Factor-23",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33669942

Child behavior measures were completed by mothers, fathers, and teachers, and parenting measures were completed by mothers. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses indicated significant post-intervention improvements in mother-rated child hyperactivity/inattention, restlessness/impulsivity, defiance/aggression, social functioning, and teacher-rated prosocial behavior, as well as significant improvements in maternal over-reactivity, verbosity, laxness, positive parenting, parenting satisfaction, self-efficacy, stress, and depression. At 6-month follow-up, effects were maintained for maternal over-reactivity and verbosity, parenting satisfaction and self-efficacy, and parental stress and depression. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of an online self-help parenting program in reducing preschool inattentive behavior difficulties, and in increasing parenting competence, satisfaction in the parenting role, and maternal well-being.","Affiliations 1 The University of Auckland, New Zealand. 2 The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.","Nike Franke , Louise J Keown , Matthew R Sanders ",J Atten Disord,2020 Oct,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity* / therapy,Child,Child, Preschool,Fathers,Female,Humans,Male,Mothers,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27609783
432,Recognizing children's emotions in child abuse and neglect,"Past research has suggested that parents' ability to recognize their children's emotions is associated with an enhanced quality of parent-child interactions and appropriateness of parental caregiving behavior. Although this association has also been examined in abusive and neglectful parents, the results are mixed and do not adequately address child neglect. Based on the Social Information Processing model of child abuse and neglect, we examined the association between mothers' ability to recognize children's emotions and self- and professionals-reported child abuse and neglect. The ability to recognize children's emotions was assessed with an implicit valence classification task and an emotion labeling task. A convenience sample of 166 mothers (78 with at least one child referred to Child Protection Services) completed the tasks. Child abuse and neglect were measured with self-report and professionals-report instruments. The moderating role of mothers' intellectual functioning and socioeconomic status were also examined. Results revealed that abusive mothers performed more poorly on the negative emotions recognition task, while neglectful mothers demonstrated a lower overall ability in recognizing children's emotions. When classifying the valence of emotions, mothers who obtained higher scores on child neglect presented a higher positivity bias particularly when their scores in measures of intellectual functioning were low. There was no moderation effect for socioeconomic status. Moreover, the results for child abuse were mainly observed with self-report measures, while for child neglect, they predominantly emerged with professionals-report. Our findings highlight the important contribution of the social information processing model in the context of child maltreatment, with implications for prevention and intervention addressed.","Affiliations 1 Iscte-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal. 2 Faculdade de Psicologia, CICPSI, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal.","Cláudia Camilo , Margarida Vaz Garrido , Maria Manuela Calheiros ",Aggress Behav,2021 Mar,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Child Abuse*,Child Behavior,Emotions*,Female,Humans,Mothers,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33164223

434,Theory of mind processing in expectant fathers: Associations with prenatal oxytocin and parental attunement,"Social cognition may facilitate fathers' sensitive caregiving behavior. We administered the Why-How Task, an fMRI task that elicits theory of mind processing, to expectant fathers (n = 39) who also visited the laboratory during their partner's pregnancy and provided a plasma sample for oxytocin assay. Three months postpartum, fathers reported their beliefs about parenting. When rating ""Why"" an action was being performed versus ""How"" the action was being performed (Why > How contrast), participants showed activation in regions theorized to support theory of mind, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus. Fathers' prenatal oxytocin levels predicted greater signal change during the Why > How contrast in the inferior parietal lobule. Both prenatal oxytocin and attunement parenting beliefs were associated with Why > How activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a theory of mind region implicated in emotion regulation. Posterior parahippocampal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during the Why > How contrast predicted fathers' attunement parenting beliefs.

439,Parents' Experiences of Their Child's Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse,"A child's disclosure of sexual victimization is a difficult experience for parents and has been associated with traumatization, disbelief, denial, self-blame, and clinical difficulties. To date, most studies on parents' responses have been quantitative assessments of the psychological impact of disclosure on parents. A paucity of research has qualitatively explored mothers' experiences of their child's disclosure of child sexual abuse (CSA) and fathers' experiences have been even further neglected. The current study seeks to characterize parents' experiences of their child's disclosure of CSA and to uncover the process-oriented nature of parental responses. This qualitative study, using a grounded theory approach to analysis, involved interviews with 10 mothers and four fathers whose children (3-18 years) had experienced sexual abuse. Three themes emerged from the analysis. The first theme-making sense of the abuse in retrospect-captured the process through which parents sought to make sense of their child's disclosure, focusing on why their child had not disclosed the abuse to them earlier, and how they had noticed something was wrong but misattributed their child's behavior to other factors. The second theme-negotiating parental identity as protector-reflected how parents' identity as a protector was challenged, their perception of their world had been forever altered, and they now experienced themselves as hypervigilant and overprotective. The final theme-navigating the services-pertained to parents' struggle in navigating child protection and police services, and feelings of being isolated and alone. These findings highlight the need for empathy and parental support following child disclosure of sexual victimization.","Affiliations 1 Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland. 2 Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.","Rosaleen McElvaney , Elizabeth Nixon ",Fam Process,2020 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Adolescent,Child,Child Abuse, Sexual / psychology*,Crime Victims / psychology*,Female,Grounded Theory,Humans,Male,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Perception,Qualitative Research,Truth Disclosure*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31715020
440,The Social Ecology of Parental Monitoring: Parent-Child Dynamics in a High-Risk Peruvian Neighborhood,"While parental monitoring is understood to protect adolescents from engaging in risk behaviors, little is known about how the family dynamics involved in parental monitoring differ across sociocultural contexts. We sought to gain an in-depth understanding of parent-child relationship dynamics and parental knowledge of adolescents' activities in an urban Peruvian neighborhood with high levels of crime and adolescent substance use. We conducted 15 in-depth interviews and two focus groups with adolescents and 12 in-depth interviews with mothers sampled from a secondary school in Callao, Peru. Our findings emphasize the importance of parent-child confianza (trust) as a foundation for parental awareness of adolescents' lives and activities. Participants in our sample characterized confianza as encouraging adolescent disclosure and shaping how parental solicitation and rules were interpreted by adolescents. Participants described how confianza was rooted in features of the parent-child relationship, including shared parent-child time, parental affection, adolescent perceptions of parents' ability to give good advice, and awareness of how parents would react to delicate topics. Participants linked these family dynamics, in turn, to economic hardship, parental feelings of sacrifice and stress, perceptions of neighborhood risk, and gender norms limiting fathers' involvement in caregiving. Results have implications for the planning and adaptation of family-based prevention programs for use in high-risk contexts in Latin America.","Affiliations 1 Department of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada. 2 Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. 3 Departament of Public Health, School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Perú.","Katherine W Pizarro , Pamela J Surkan , Inés V Bustamante ",Fam Process,2021 Mar,"Adolescent,Adolescent Behavior*,Female,Humans,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting,Parents,Peru,Social Environment",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32356372

442,Reconsidering the relation between parental functioning and child externalizing behaviors: A meta-analysis on child-driven effects,"Guided by multiple theories illustrating the transactional nature of the relation between parents' and children's behaviors, the present meta-analysis provides synthesized evidence on the strength of child-driven effects in eliciting changes in parents' psychological stress and parenting practices. A meta-analysis of 45 independent samples with 640 effect sizes found significant positive associations between children's externalizing behaviors and parents' subsequent functioning (r = .087, 95% CI [.07, .10]). These associations were net of parents' functioning at baseline, and the strength of these associations was statistically comparable with the effects of parents on children's externalizing behaviors (r = .075, 95% CI [.06, .09]). In addition, the strength of the child-driven effects did not vary as a function of child gender, age, or the time interval between assessments. The implications of these findings with respect to research on the dynamic relation between parenting functioning and children's adjustment are discussed.

443,Sleep's short-term memory preservation and long-term affect depotentiation effect in emotional memory consolidation: behavioral and EEG evidence,"Study objectives: Sleep plays a pivotal role in the off-line processing of emotional memory. However, much remains unknown for its immediate vs. long-term influences. We employed behavioral and electrophysiological measures to investigate the short- and long-term impacts of sleep vs. sleep deprivation on emotional memory. Methods: Fifty-nine participants incidentally learned 60 negative and 60 neutral pictures in the evening and were randomly assigned to either sleep or sleep deprivation conditions. We measured memory recognition and subjective affective ratings in 12- and 60-h post-encoding tests, with EEGs in the delayed test. Results: In a 12-h post-encoding test, compared to sleep deprivation, sleep equally preserved both negative and neutral memory, and their affective tones. In the 60-h post-encoding test, negative and neutral memories declined significantly in the sleep group, with attenuated emotional responses to negative memories over time. Furthermore, two groups showed spatial-temporally distinguishable ERPs at the delayed test: while both groups showed the old-new frontal negativity (300-500 ms, FN400), sleep-deprived participants additionally showed an old-new parietal, Late Positive Component effect (600-1000 ms, LPC). Multivariate whole-brain ERPs analyses further suggested that sleep prioritized neural representation of emotion over memory processing, while they were less distinguishable in the sleep deprivation group. Conclusions: These data suggested that sleep's impact on emotional memory and affective responses is time-dependent: sleep preserved memories and affective tones in the short term, while ameliorating affective tones in the long term. Univariate and multivariate EEG analyses revealed different neurocognitive processing of remote, emotional memories between sleep and sleep deprivation groups.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. 2 Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, USA. 3 The State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. 4 HKU-Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation, Shenzhen, China.","Shengzi Zeng , Xuanyi Lin , Jingxuan Wang , Xiaoqing Hu ",Sleep,2021 Nov 12,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Electroencephalography,Emotions / physiology,Humans,Long-Term Synaptic Depression,Memory Consolidation* / physiology,Memory, Short-Term,Sleep / physiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34153105

A tertiary referral cardiac center experience,"Background: Pregnant women with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and their offspring are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Aims: To provide data on pregnancy outcomes among women with different types of CVD requiring non-elective cardiac hospitalization in a tertiary referral cardiac center. Methods: We identified all records of non-elective hospitalizations of pregnant women hospitalized between January 2009 through March 2018, at our institution - a tertiary referral cardiac center. The incidence and types of cardiac complications during pregnancy, as well as the pregnancy and offspring outcomes, were determined. Results: One hundred and sixty-one out of 328 pregnancy-related hospitalizations in 140 pregnancies were non-elective. Cardiac complications occurred in 62 (44%) pregnancies, with the most frequent being episodes of arrhythmia (22.1% pregnancies), followed by heart failure exacerbations (6.4% pregnancies). Maternal mortality reached 2.1% and affected only women with primary cardiomyopathies (CMP). Offspring mortality was 2.8%. Newborns of mothers with cardiac complications had significantly lower Apgar scores and gestational age at delivery, compared to mothers without cardiac complications. Conclusions: In our series mortality and morbidity among pregnant women with CVD hospitalizations were high. An unfavorable maternal outcome mainly affected women with CMP. Offspring of mothers with cardiovascular complications are prone to have a lower gestational age and Apgar score.","Affiliations 1 Department of Congenital Heart Disease, National Institute of Cardiology, Warszawa, Poland. 2 Central Clinical Hospital MSWiA and Center of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warszawa, Poland. 3 Department of Oncological Gynecology and Obstetrics, Center of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warszawa, Poland. 4 Department of Coronary Artery Disease and Cardiac Rehabilitation, National Institute of Cardiology, Warszawa, Poland. 5 Department of Heart Failure and Transplantology, National Institute of Cardiology, Warszawa, Poland. 6 Department of Arrhythmia, National Institute of Cardiology, Warszawa, Poland. 7 Department of Cardiomyopathy, National Institute of Cardiology, Warszawa, Poland. 8 Department of Coronary and Structural Heart Diseases, National Institute of Cardiology, Warszawa, Poland. 9 Department of Hypertension, National Institute of Cardiology, Warszawa, Poland.","Magdalena Lipczyńska , Kamila Janisz , Piotr Szymański , Elżbieta K Biernacka , Katarzyna Hanus-Durlej , Marzena Dębska , Ilona Kowalik , Anna Drohomirecka , Joanna Zakrzewska-Koperska , Agnieszka Sioma , Karolina Kryczka , Aleksander Prejbisz , Piotr Hoffman ",Kardiol Pol,2021,"Female,Gestational Age,Heart Diseases*,Hospitalization,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular* / epidemiology,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Referral and Consultation,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33926168

447,Herbal Medicine for Adult Patients with Cough Variant Asthma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Introduction: Herbal medicine is commonly used by patients with chronic cough, but the role of herbal medicine for cough variant asthma (CVA) has not yet been clearly defined. For the first time, we performed a meta-analysis to integrate the current evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic and assess the efficacy of herbal medicine in adults with CVA. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in electronic databases to identify RCTs of herbal medicine for adult CVA. Cochrane systematic review methods were followed, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was performed to evaluate the quality of evidence. Results: Twenty-eight RCTs were included. Compared with placebo, moderate-quality evidence from two studies showed that herbal medicine was associated with reduced cough symptom score (CSS) (MD -1.15 points; 95% CI, -1.67 to -0.63) and visual analogue scale (VAS) (MD -1.76 points; 95% CI, -2.66 to -0.86). Compared with montelukast, low- to moderate-quality evidence from 11 studies indicated that herbal medicine was associated with improved Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (MD 2.38 points; 95% CI, 1.32 to 3.44), reduced CSS (SMD -0.81 points; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.53), and VAS (MD -1.34 points; 95% CI, -1.82 to -0.86). There were no significant differences between herbal medicine and ICS plus bronchodilator. Conclusions: In adults with CVA, herbal medicine may result in improved quality of life and reduced cough frequency and severity scores compared with placebo or montelukast. Herbal medicine was not better than ICS plus a bronchodilator but the evidence is very uncertain.","Affiliations 1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Clinical College of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China. 2 School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.","Yuan-Bin Chen , Johannah L Shergis , Zhen-Hu Wu , Xin-Feng Guo , Anthony L Zhang , Lei Wu , Fei-Ting Fan , Yin-Ji Xu , Charlie C Xue , Lin Lin ",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,2021 Mar 2,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33747103

451,The relationship between parental food parenting practices & child eating behavior: A comparison of mothers and fathers,"The objective of this study was to compare the relationships between food parenting practices and child eating behavior among mothers and fathers of young children. This cross-sectional study recruited mothers (n = 127) and fathers (n = 118) of children (4.2 ± 1.3 years old) to complete surveys (face-to-face and online). Each parent completed the Comprehensive Food Parenting Questionnaire, Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and demographic questions. Linear regressions were used to compare the relationships between parental food parenting practices and children's eating behaviors with parent sex as a moderator. Child age and sex served as control variables in each regression. Parent sex was a significant moderator in several relationships between parent food parenting practices and child eating behavior. In the relationship between parental restriction for health (ß = -.14, p = .014) and monitoring (ß = -.13, p = .028) and child slowness in eating, the slope of the interaction was significantly higher for mothers, meaning that when mothers and fathers use the same level of restriction for health and monitoring, child slowness in eating is higher for children of mothers. When mothers and fathers used the same level of restriction for weight, child food responsiveness (ß = .13, p = .003) and emotional overeating (ß = .12, p = .046) was significantly higher for children of fathers. There may be differences in how mothers and fathers implement food parenting practices and/or differences in how these practices impact children. Specifically, for fathers, it seems that the use of restriction for weight is more detrimental for children's eating behaviors compared to when mothers use the same level of restriction for weight.","Affiliation 1 Illinois State University, Campus Box 5060, Normal, IL, 61790, USA.

This study used cost-effectiveness analyses to calculate average cost-effectiveness ratios, which represents the average cost for one family to change one standard deviation on each outcome measure: externalizing behavior problems, positive parenting skills, negative parenting skills, child compliance, and parenting stress. While it had the lowest initial set up cost, results indicated that standard PCIT was the least cost-effective option in reducing child disruptive behaviors and in increasing child compliance. Large group PCIT was the most cost-effective in increasing positive parenting skills and child compliance and in reducing negative parenting skills and parenting stress. I-PCIT was the most cost-effective in reducing child disruptive behaviors and the second most cost-effective option in increasing positive parenting skills and child compliance and in decreasing negative parenting. As large group and I-PCIT were the most cost-effective in different domains, both could be recommended to parents as treatment options.

456,Modeling sleep onset misperception in insomnia,"Objectives: To extend and validate a previously suggested model of the influence of uninterrupted sleep bouts on sleep onset misperception in a large independent data set. Methods: Polysomnograms and sleep diaries of 139 insomnia patients and 92 controls were included. We modeled subjective sleep onset as the start of the first uninterrupted sleep fragment longer than Ls minutes, where parameter Ls reflects the minimum length of a sleep fragment required to be perceived as sleep. We compared the so-defined sleep onset latency (SOL) for various values of Ls. Model parameters were compared between groups, and across insomnia subgroups with respect to sleep onset misperception, medication use, age, and sex. Next, we extended the model to incorporate the length of wake fragments. Model performance was assessed by calculating root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the difference between estimated and perceived SOL. Results: Participants with insomnia needed a median of 34 minutes of undisturbed sleep to perceive sleep onset, while healthy controls needed 22 minutes (Mann-Whitney U = 4426, p < 0.001). Similar statistically significant differences were found between sleep onset misperceivers and non-misperceivers (median 40 vs. 20 minutes, Mann-Whitney U = 984.5, p < 0.001). Model outcomes were similar across other subgroups. Extended models including wake bout lengths resulted in only marginal improvements of model outcome. Conclusions: Patients with insomnia, particularly sleep misperceivers, need larger continuous sleep bouts to perceive sleep onset. The modeling approach yields a parameter for which we coin the term Sleep Fragment Perception Index, providing a useful measure to further characterize sleep state misperception.","Affiliations 1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, De Zaale, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. 2 Center for Sleep Medicine, Kempenhaeghe Foundation, Heeze, Noord Brabant, The Netherlands. 3 Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, De Zaale, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. 4 Philips Research, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. 5 Department of Orthodontics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. 6 Department of Industrial Design, Eindhoven University of Technology, De Zaale, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.","Lieke W A Hermans , Merel M van Gilst , Marta Regis , Leonie C E van den Heuvel , Hanneke Langen , Petra van Mierlo , Roy Krijn , Bertram Hoondert , Henning Maass , Johannes P van Dijk , Tim R M Leufkens , Sebastiaan Overeem ",Sleep,2020 Aug 12,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Humans,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders*,Sleep Latency",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32016410

To address this issue, parents' reports on their dispositional selfishness, negative and positive parenting behavior, and child's psychopathic traits were collected for a group of children from the community (n = 118, 47% male, mean age = 14.1 years). Results showed that parental selfishness was associated with grandiose-manipulative (GM), daring-impulsive (DI), and callous-unemotional (CU) traits in children. In addition, the egocentric selfishness-GM relationship was indirectly mediated by parenting behavior including lack of involvement, poor monitoring, and inconsistent discipline, whereas the association with CU traits was directly mediated by lack of involvement. These effects remained significant after controlling for child's sex, age, race, social adversity, and a prior measure of psychopathic traits. Findings provide initial empirical evidence on the effect of parental selfishness on a child's psychopathic traits, and further support to the proposition that distinct etiology may underlie different dimensions of psychopathic traits.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, Brooklyn, New York, USA. 2 The Graduate Center of the City University of New York, New York, New York, USA. 3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey, USA.","Yu Gao , Yonglin Huang , Xiaobo Li ",Behav Sci Law,2021 Oct,"Adolescent,Female,Humans,Male,Parenting*,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34668235
458,Sex differences in sleep and influence of the menstrual cycle on women's sleep in junior endurance athletes,"Previous research shows that female athletes sleep better according to objective parameters but report worse subjective sleep quality than male athletes. However, existing sleep studies did not investigate variations in sleep and sleep stages over longer periods and have, so far, not elucidated the role of the menstrual cycle in female athletes' sleep. To address these methodological shortcomings, we investigated sex differences in sleep and sleep stages over 61 continuous days in 37 men and 19 women and examined the role of the menstrual cycle and its phases in 15 women. Sleep was measured by a non-contact radar, and menstrual bleeding was self-reported. Associations were investigated with multilevel modeling. Overall, women tended to report poorer subjective sleep quality (p = .057), but objective measurements showed that women obtained longer sleep duration (p < .001), more light (p = .013) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM; hours (h): p < .001, %: p = .007), shorter REM latency (p < .001), and higher sleep efficiency (p = .003) than men. R2 values showed that sleep duration, REM and REM latency were especially affected by sex. Among women, we found longer time in bed (p = .027) and deep sleep (h: p = .036), and shorter light sleep (%: p = .021) during menstrual bleeding vs. non-bleeding days; less light sleep (h: p = .040), deep sleep (%: p = .013) and shorter REM latency (p = .011) during the menstrual than pre-menstrual phase; and lower sleep efficiency (p = .042) and more deep sleep (%: p = .026) during the follicular than luteal phase. These findings indicate that the menstrual cycle may impact the need for physiological recovery, as evidenced by the sleep stage variations. Altogether, the observed sex differences in subjective and objective sleep parameters may be related to the female athletes' menstrual cycle. The paper provides unique data of sex differences in sleep stages and novel insights into the role of the menstrual cycle in sleep among female athletes.","Affiliations 1 Center for Elite Sports Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. 2 Faculty of Social and Educational Sciences, Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. 3 Faculty of Psychology, Department of Psychosocial Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. 4 Norwegian Competence Center for Sleep Disorders, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. 5 Optentia, the Vaal Triangle Campus of the North-West University, Vanderbijlpark, South-Africa. 6 Faculty of Social and Educational Sciences, Department of Education and Lifelong Learning, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.","Maria Hrozanova , Christian A Klöckner , Øyvind Sandbakk , Ståle Pallesen , Frode Moen ",PLoS One,2021 Jun 17,"Adolescent,Athletes*,Circadian Rhythm / physiology,Female,Humans,Male,Menstrual Cycle / physiology*,Sex Characteristics,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Stages / physiology*,Wakefulness / physiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34138961
459,Reproductive and pregnancy outcomes following embryo transfer in women with previous cesarean section: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: Cesarean section affects subsequent spontaneous pregnancies because of implantation issues. However, its impact on post-embryo transfer pregnancies is still debated. This review aimed to evaluate the impact of a previous cesarean section on fertility and pregnancy outcomes of women undergoing fresh or frozen embryo transfer. Material and methods: MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Scielo, EMBASE, Cochrane Library at the CENTRAL, and LILACS were searched from inception to February 2021. Studies were included if they evaluated reproductive or pregnancy outcomes after fresh or frozen embryo transfer in infertile women with a previous cesarean section relative to women with a previous vaginal delivery. Random-effect meta-analyses to calculate risk ratio (RR) or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) followed by subgroup analysis for fresh and frozen embryo transfer were performed. Risk of bias and quality assessment were conducted using Newcastle-Ottawa scale and GRADE criteria. The review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021226297). Results: Ten studies, with data provided for 13 696 participants, were eligible. For embryo transfers after cesarean section, compared with vaginal delivery, there was a significant reduction of the live birth rate (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.99) and biochemical pregnancy rate (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96). No statistically significant differences were found for clinical pregnancy rate (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.02), ectopic pregnancies (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68-1.46), pregnancy loss (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94-1.18), multiple pregnancies (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63-1.02), stillbirths (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.27-2.69), birth defects (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.49-5.96) or birthweight (mean difference 46.82, 95% CI -40.16 to 133.80). Subgroup analysis revealed an increased risk for preterm birth in post-cesarean section fresh embryo transfer pregnancies (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.16-2.19). Conclusions: Low-grade evidence shows that post-embryo transfer pregnancies in infertile women who had a previous cesarean delivery result in reduced biochemical pregnancy and live birth rates relative to women with a previous vaginal delivery. An increased risk for preterm birth is notable in post-fresh embryo transfer pregnancies.","Affiliation 1 Department of Woman, Child, and General and Specialized Surgery, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.","Gaetano Riemma , Pasquale De Franciscis , Marco Torella , Giuliana Narciso , Marco La Verde , Maddalena Morlando , Luigi Cobellis , Nicola Colacurci ",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,2021 Nov,"Meta-Analysis,Systematic Review,Cesarean Section*,Embryo Transfer*,Female,Humans,Infertility, Female / etiology*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34414568
460,"Motor Activity and ""Neotenic"" Sleep in the Naked Mole Rat (Heterocephalus glaber) under Isolation","For the first time, continuous registration of motor activity and electroencephalogram for 40 days was carried out in four individuals of the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) in isolated conditions in the laboratory. A clear circadian rhythm of motor activity was found, with a gradual decrease during the night and an increase during the day, which remained both in the 12L/12D mode and in conditions of complete darkness. The rest states occupied, on average, about half the time of the day. There were both typical and atypical sleep periods, in which REM sleep episodes preceded NREM sleep periods. REM sleep percentage was unusually high (up to 50% of the total sleep time). During REM sleep episodes, a synchronized two-phase high-amplitude rhythm with a frequency of 12-16 Hz was recorded in the EEG. In addition, there were hard-to-identify periods of sleep, combining elements of both NREM and REM sleep. The sleep structure of naked mole rats resembles that of evolutionarily ancient species, as well as the ""disorganized"" sleep characteristic of the early stages of ontogenesis in altricial mammals.","Affiliations 1 Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119071, Moscow, Russia. kovalzon@sevin.ru. 2 Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology, Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.","V M Kovalzon , O A Averina , M Yu Vysokikh ",Dokl Biol Sci,2021 Jan,"Animals,Circadian Rhythm / physiology*,Electroencephalography,Mole Rats / physiology*,Motor Activity / physiology*,Photoperiod,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep, REM",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33635486
461,Perceived Paternal and Maternal Parenting Attributes among Chinese Adolescents: A Meta-Analysis,"This meta-analysis study examined perceived parental differences between Chinese mothers and fathers from the perspective of adolescents. A systematic search for relevant articles published up to 2019 was performed in electronic databases. The random-effect model was used to calculate the weighted and pooled effect size at the 95% confidence interval. This study was based on 43 studies in English peer-reviewed journals involving 55,759 Chinese adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years. We conducted subgroup analyses to explore whether differences in study designs (i.e., cross-sectional and longitudinal) and adolescent gender could explain perceived parental differences. The results showed that perceived maternal parenting attributes were more positive than perceived paternal parenting attributes in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Besides, perceived paternal parenting attributes showed slightly greater variability than did maternal parenting attributes. Subgroup analysis based on adolescent gender revealed that only adolescent girls perceived maternal parenting attributes to be more positive than paternal parenting attributes.","Affiliation 1 Department of Applied Social Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China.","Diya Dou , Daniel T L Shek , Ka Ho Robin Kwok ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020 Nov 24,"Meta-Analysis,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Asians,Child,China,Cross-Sectional Studies,Fathers*,Female,Humans,Male,Mothers,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting* / ethnology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33255504
462,"Why do married women procure abortion? Experiences from Ile-Ife, south western Nigeria","Background: In Nigeria, about 1.25million induced abortions occur annually and the country accounts for one-fifth of abortion-related deaths globally. Objectives: The study aimed to assess the determinants of induced abortion among married women. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The quantitative component employed a cross-sectional study design while the qualitative aspect comprised focus group discussions. Information on contraceptives use, unintended pregnancy and induced abortion were obtained from 402 married women (with at least one child) aged 18-49 years using a semi-structured questionnaire. Four focus group discussion sessions were conducted among women of reproductive age. Results: Majority (67.2%) of respondents had ever used a contraceptive method. However, 34.3% of the women have had unintended pregnancies and 14.2% had induced abortion. FGD findings revealed that non-use of contraceptives and contraceptive failure were major reasons for unintended pregnancies and induced abortion. The significant predictors of induced abortion were non-use of contraceptives, age≥ 40 years and multiparity. Conclusion: Induced abortion still occur among married women particularly those not using contraceptives, aged ≥40 years and those with high parity. More emphasis should be placed on making contraceptives more accessible to married women.","Affiliations 1 Primary Health Center, Enuwa, Ile-Ife, Family Planning Unit. 2 Obafemi Awolowo University College of Health Sciences, Department of Community Health. 3 Obafemi Awolowo University College of Health Sciences, Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Perinatology.","Ibitola Eunice Ojo , Temitope Olumuyiwa Ojo , Ernest Okechukwu Orji ",Afr Health Sci,2021 Mar,"Abortion, Induced / statistics & numerical data*,Adolescent,Adult,Contraception Behavior / statistics & numerical data*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Marriage / statistics & numerical data*,Nigeria,Parity,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned*,Pregnancy, Unwanted*,Surveys and Questionnaires,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34394314
463,Contextual Factors Impact the Variability in ADHD Symptoms in Preschoolers with Situational Hyperactivity,"Objective: This study examined preschoolers with teacher-reported or parent-reported situational hyperactivity, and whether they differed in terms of behavioral problems, attentional problems, and parenting perceptions. Method: We used the Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test and the Color Flanker Task to assess 99 preschoolers with pervasive high-ADHD-symptoms (42), school-situational high-ADHD-symptoms (30), or home-situational high-ADHD-symptoms (27), plus 111 preschoolers with pervasive low-ADHD-symptoms. Parents and teachers reported externalizing/internalizing behavioral problems. Parenting perceptions were measured with the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form and a parenting perceptions scale. Results: Preschoolers with school-situational high-ADHD-symptoms had deficits in attentional control. Parents of preschoolers with home-situational high-ADHD-symptoms had higher levels of parental stress and perceived their parenting to be harsher. Preschoolers with pervasive high-ADHD-symptoms had deficits in attentional control, increased parental stress, and parents with harsher parenting perceptions. Conclusion: Preschoolers with situational high-ADHD-symptoms may have different contextual risk factors related to ADHD symptoms reported by parents versus teachers.","Affiliations 1 Chang Gung University, Taoyuan. 2 Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taoyuan. 3 National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei.","Shoou-Lian Hwang-Gu , Hsing-Chang Ni , Sophie Hsin-Yi Liang , Hsiang-Yuan Lin , Li Tsao , Chiao-Fan Lin , Susan Shur-Fen Gau ",J Atten Disord,2021 Nov,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Attention,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*,Humans,Parenting,Parents,Psychomotor Agitation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32659134

In this study, 11 healthy young men were exposed to three conditions for 1 h before bedtime: 1) incandescent light, 2) blue-light, or 3) blue light-blocking glasses on. The following morning, subjective sleep quality was measured using the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi Sleep Inventory. Sleep time, ratio of sleep, ratio of deep sleep, and body movements during sleep were measured using a mat sleep-scan (sleep scan, SL- 504; TANITA Corp., Japan) and an ambulatory portable sleep study system (LS-140; Fukuda Denshi Co. Ltd., Japan). Ratio of deep sleep was significantly decreased in the blue-light exposure group compared to the groups with incandescent light and blue light-blocking glasses (p < 0.01), There were no differences noted in sleep time or body movements among the three groups. These results suggest that blue-light exposure to affects sleep quality by reducing the ratio of deep sleep.","Affiliations 1 Department of Occupational Therapy, Yamagata College of Medical Arts & Sciences, Japan. 2 Area of Occupational Therapy, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Yamagata Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Japan. 3 Area of Occupational Therapy, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Yamagata Prefectural University of Health Sciences, Japan.

467,"Constructive and destructive interparental conflict, parenting, and coparenting alliance","Guided by the spillover hypothesis of family systems theory, we used data from the Building Strong Families project to examine intrafamily relations between destructive and constructive interparental conflict, harsh and supportive parenting behaviors, and coparenting alliance across different family configurations: married, cohabiting, and noncohabiting (never married) parents. Our sample (N = 2,784 couples/parents) was racially diverse, low-income couples/parents who were unmarried at the conception of their child. All variables were measured when children were approximately 36 months of age. Interparental conflict was assessed through an instrument that included both parents' reported conflict in the relationship and the perception of the other parent's conflict behaviors. Parenting behaviors were measured through observational data and coparenting alliance was based on mothers' and fathers' reports. As expected, path analyses revealed that destructive interparental conflict was related to lower levels of coparenting alliance, whereas constructive interparental conflict was related to higher levels of coparenting alliance, for mothers and fathers. For fathers only, destructive interparental conflict related to harsh parenting, suggesting that paternal parenting is vulnerable to the quality of the relationship with the mother. None of the proposed associations differed by family structure. These findings suggest the need for intervention programs to focus on promoting adaptive conflict management behaviors rather than on family structure.

468,Conscious experiences and high-density EEG patterns predicting subjective sleep depth,"What accounts for feeling deeply asleep? Standard sleep recordings only incompletely reflect subjective aspects of sleep and some individuals with so-called sleep misperception frequently feel awake although sleep recordings indicate clear-cut sleep. To identify the determinants of sleep perception, we performed 787 awakenings in 20 good sleepers and 10 individuals with sleep misperception and interviewed them about their subjective sleep depth while they underwent high-density EEG sleep recordings. Surprisingly, in good sleepers, sleep was subjectively lightest in the first 2 h of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, generally considered the deepest sleep, and deepest in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Compared to good sleepers, sleep misperceptors felt more frequently awake during sleep and reported lighter REM sleep. At the EEG level, spatially widespread high-frequency power was inversely related to subjective sleep depth in NREM sleep in both groups and in REM sleep in misperceptors. Subjective sleep depth positively correlated with dream-like qualities of reports of mental activity. These findings challenge the widely held notion that slow wave sleep best accounts for feeling deeply asleep. Instead, they indicate that subjective sleep depth is inversely related to a neurophysiological process that predominates in early NREM sleep, becomes quiescent in REM sleep, and is reflected in high-frequency EEG activity. In sleep misperceptors, this process is more frequently active, more spatially widespread, and abnormally persists into REM sleep. These findings help identify the neuromodulatory systems involved in subjective sleep depth and are relevant for studies aiming to improve subjective sleep quality.","Affiliations 1 Center for Investigation and Research on Sleep, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Rue du Bugnon 46, 1010 Lausanne, Switzerland. 2 Center for Investigation and Research on Sleep, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Rue du Bugnon 46, 1010 Lausanne, Switzerland; Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Rue du Bugnon 46, 1010 Lausanne, Switzerland.

469,Raising Children in Risk Neighborhoods from Chile: Examining the Relationship between Parenting Stress and Parental Adjustment,"Introduction: Parenting stress and parental adjustment could implicate key differences in the relational dynamics that parents establish with their children, particularly when families come from vulnerable social contexts. Method: Participants were 142 fathers and mothers from a risk neighborhood of Chile. The variables examined were parenting stress (parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction and difficult child) and parental adjustment (depression, anxiety, and stress). Parents also completed a sociodemographic characterization survey. The statistical analyses were a correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: Overall, not all components of parenting stress were related to parental adjustment. Only parental distress was found as a significant predictor of poor parental adjustment (greater depression, anxiety, and stress), but not parent-child dysfunctional interaction and having a difficult child. Conclusions: The present study findings highlight the influence of stress on parenting as a relevant dimension of research for the improvement of the intervention deployed by the state regarding the protection of vulnerable Chilean children, providing multiple clinical and psychosocial applications for research and intervention purposes.","Affiliations 1 Escuela de Psicología, Instituto Iberoamericano de Desarrollo Sostenible, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Temuco 4810101, Chile. 2 Department of Methodology of Behavioral Sciences, Faculty of Psychology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain. 3 Faculty of Psychology, Universidad San Sebastián, Puerto Montt 5480000, Chile. 4 Instituto de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia 5110566, Chile. 5 Facultad de Educación y Cultura, Universidad SEK, Santiago 5110566, Chile. 6 Departamento de Educación Física, Deportes y Recreación, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco 4780000, Chile. 7 Department of Developmental and Educational Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain.","Eduardo Sandoval-Obando , Marta Alcaide , Miguel Salazar-Muñoz , Sebastián Peña-Troncoso , Claudio Hernández-Mosqueira , Sofia Gimenez-Serrano ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Dec 21,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Anxiety / epidemiology,Chile,Fathers,Female,Humans,Male,Mothers*,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Stress, Psychological / epidemiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35010304
470,Regulation and status of herbal medicine clinical trials in Korea: a narrative review,"Background: Herbal medicine has been used frequently in Korean medicine. We aimed to summarize the relevant regulations for herbal medicine clinical trials and to analyze their current status in the Republic of Korea. Methods: We searched for legislation to find regulations on herbal medicine clinical trials. Additionally, the websites of the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS) and Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS) were searched to investigate the current status of them. Results: To conduct herbal medicine clinical trials for new drugs or previously approved drugs outside of indications, investigational new drug (IND) approval should be obtained from the KMFDS. For clinical trials of herbal medicines that have been used for more than 3 years with 200 cases at the clinical trial institution, nonclinical data can be exempted from IND approval. Total 95 and 108 herbal medicine clinical trials from the KMFDS and CRIS websites were analyzed. The number of clinical trials showed an increasing trend each year, as did KMFDS-regulated clinical trials. Recently, three clinical trials targeting new herbal formulations frequently used in Korean medicine institutions have been approved based on relevant regulations. Conclusion: We confirmed that herbal medicine clinical trials are managed through strict regulations, which can ensure the safe and effective use of herbal medicine. Despite strict regulations, attempts to accumulate evidence through clinical trials for herbal medicine are increasing. High-quality clinical trials should be conducted to develop new drugs that reflect the clinical setting using relevant regulations, evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drugs, and strengthen insurance coverage.","Affiliation 1 Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.","Boram Lee , Yujin Choi , Pyung-Wha Kim , Changsop Yang , Myeong Soo Lee ",Integr Med Res,2021 Jun,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33717976
471,An Integrative Review of Experiences Parenting Transgender and Gender Diverse Children,"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) children face increased behavioral health risks including suicidal behaviors and substance abuse. Parental affirmation is associated with behavioral health outcomes similar to non-TGD peers. This integrative review synthesizes and appraises evidence regarding experiences of parenting a TGD child in the United States or Canada from 2008 to 2018. Most parents across these 15 studies described affirming their child's gender at time of interview. Parents reported initial interpersonal processes (emotions, concerns, beliefs), sought education (frequently online), and described interactions with family members and professionals that were not always affirming. Parents accessed support groups but described their own well-being as a low priority relative to the child's needs. Parents' own needs for well-being may affect the process of parenting a TGD child and should be explored. Future research should address the experiences of non-parent family members and participants from more diverse backgrounds. Nursing education must consistently address gender affirming care.","Affiliations 1 New York University Rory Meyers College of Nursing, New York City, USA. 2 Rutgers School of Nursing, Newark, NJ, USA.","Amy Warner , Caroline Dorsen , Ann-Margaret Dunn Navarra , Sally Cohen ",J Fam Nurs,2021 Nov,"Review,Child,Gender Identity,Humans,Parenting,Parents,Substance-Related Disorders*,Transgender Persons*,United States",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33855890
472,Patterns and Trends of Herbal Medicine Use among Patients with Gynecologic Cancer,"Background More and more information about complementary and integrative medicine is becoming available, especially among cancer patients. However, little is known about the use of herbal medicine by patients with gynecologic cancers. This study aimed to assess the use of herbal products by gynecologic cancer patients compared with healthy controls. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department for Gynecology and Obstetrics of Erlangen University Hospital and included 201 patients with gynecologic cancer and 212 healthy controls. Use of herbal medicines was evaluated using a standardized questionnaire. Medical information on cancer patients was collected from hospital records. Group comparisons were done using a logistic regression model. Risk ratios were assessed using a Poisson regression model. Results Gynecologic cancer patients used herbal medicine significantly less often than healthy persons. 69% of gynecologic cancer patients and 81% of healthy participants reported using herbal products. 40% of cancer patients and 56% of healthy persons reported using plants for medicinal purposes. Motives of cancer patients for using herbal medicine included treatment of cancer-related symptoms. The major source of information for both groups was family and friends. Conclusions Although herbal medicine was used less by patients with gynecologic cancer, herbal products were used by both cancer patients and healthy individuals. To provide cancer patients with optimal therapy, oncologists should be informed about the herbal products used by their patients as this will allow them to take their patients' self-medication with herbal medicine into account.

473,Association between problematic behaviors and individual/environmental factors in difficult children,"Background: Difficult children are ones whose behavior deviates from the norm, which manifests as restlessness, violence, and difficulty in separating from the mother. Such problematic behaviors usually exhaust their parents during child rearing. This study aimed to identify individual and environmental factors that influence children's problematic behavior, which could be helpful in supporting parents' child rearing. Methods: Records of children's problematic behaviors and their individual or environmental information were collected from 8691 children at their 5-year-old health checks. Problematic behaviors were divided into three categories; anxious behaviors, developmental behaviors, and personal habits. Individual factors included sex, parental age, birth order, birth weight, and birth abnormalities. The environmental factors were mother's smoking during pregnancy or currently, partner's cooperation in child rearing, having someone to consult about child rearing, and television viewing time. Using logistic regression, we identified the association between such behaviors and aggravating factors. Results: Problematic behavior was identified in 2.2%, 11.5%, and 16.1% of cases, respectively, with regard to anxious behaviors, developmental behaviors, and personal habits. The individual factors (including birth order and birth abnormality), and the environmental factors (including mothers currently smoking, lack of someone to consult about child rearing, and long television-watching time) were associated with the odd ratio of increased risk for some problematic behaviors. Conclusion: Behaviors in difficult children are not influenced by individual factors but by several environmental factors. To reduce the parental child rearing burden, health providers should be aware of these aggravating factors.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan. 2 Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.

474,The potential side effects of herbal preparations in domestic animals,"A recent series of deaths in previously healthy dogs in Victoria, Australia associated with the ingestion of raw meat contaminated by indospicine derived from native Australian plants of the Indigofera species draws attention to the potential that exists for herbal toxicity in domestic animals. Although the efficacy of herbal remedies generally remains unproven in domestic animals, herbal preparations are being increasingly used as supplements and treatments. Issues with incorrect ingredients, inadequate processing, faulty, incomplete or inaccurate product labelling, contamination with toxins, adulteration with undeclared pharmaceutical agents and herb-herb interactions are well recognized as causes of adverse effects in humans. However, apart from of the effects of noxious weed species, the literature on herbal toxicity in domestic animals is sparse. Thus, the forensic evaluation of cases of suspected poisoning in domestic animals should also encompass an accurate description the type and dose of any herbal preparations that may have been recently administered.","Affiliations 1 Adelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. roger.byard@sa.gov.au. 2 Adelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.","Roger W Byard , Ian Musgrave ",Forensic Sci Med Pathol,2021 Dec,"Animals,Animals, Domestic*,Dogs,Drug Contamination,Herb-Drug Interactions,Plant Preparations*,Victoria,Plant Preparations",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34417949
475,"Barriers to access, implementation, and utilization of parenting interventions: Considerations for research and clinical applications","In February 2019, the American Psychological Association approved a resolution on physical discipline of children by parents that recognized its negative impact on children; called for increased use of more effective, alternate forms of discipline; and highlighted the need for greater access to behavioral parenting intervention for underserved groups. Despite a wealth of empirical evidence supporting these statements and similar resolutions by other influential organizations (e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics, American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children), many challenges exist in providing empirically supported parent training interventions to individuals in need. The current article reviews many barriers to access and implementation of best practices for parents of children and adolescents, including structural barriers to accessing care and factors that interfere with effective delivery of interventions. The review also provides suggestions for clinicians, researchers, and public policy advocates to begin making progress toward reducing and removing these barriers.

476,Effects of all-night exposure to ambient odour on dreams and affective state upon waking,"Previous laboratory research has shown that exposure to odours of contrasting pleasantness during sleep differentially affects the emotional tone of dreams. In the present study, we sought to investigate how a generally pleasant (vanillin) and unpleasant (thioglycolic acid [TGA]) smell influenced various dream characteristics, dream emotions, and post-sleep core affect during all-night exposure, controlling for appraisal of the olfactory environment during the assessments and sleep stage from which the participants woke up. We expected that exposure to vanillin would result in more pleasant dreams, more positive and less negative dream emotions, and a more positive post-sleep core affect compared to the control condition, whereas exposure to TGA would have the opposite effect. Sixty healthy volunteers (36 males, mean age 24 ± 4 years) were invited to visit the sleep laboratory three times in weekly intervals. The first visit served to adapt the participants to the laboratory environment. On the second visit, half the participants were exposed to an odour (vanillin or TGA, 1:1) and the other half to the odourless control condition. On the third visit, they received control or exposure in a balanced order. On each visit, the participants woke up twice, first from the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage and then in the morning, usually from a non-REM sleep stage. Repeated measures were taken upon each awakening. Dream pleasantness, emotional charge of the dream, positive and negative emotions experienced in the dream, and four dimensions of post-sleep core affect (valence, activation, pleasant activation - unpleasant deactivation, and unpleasant activation - pleasant deactivation) were assessed. We found a small effect of condition (exposure vs. control) in interaction with appraisal of the ambient olfactory environment on dream pleasantness. Specifically, false alarms (i.e., perceiving odour in the absence of the target stimulus) were associated with lower dream pleasantness than correct rejections. Although exposure had a statistically significant positive influence on post-sleep core affect (namely, valence, activation, and pleasant activation - unpleasant deactivation), the size of the effect was small and lacked practical significance. The hypothesised differential effects of vanillin and TGA were only modelled for dream ratings because they decreased the fit of the other models. Neither dream pleasantness nor emotionality differed according to the odour used for stimulation. The results of the present study suggest that all-night exposure to odours is unlikely to produce practically significant positive effects on dreams and post-sleep core affect.","Affiliations 1 National Institute of Mental Health, Topolová 748, 250 67 Klecany, Czech Republic; Department of Psychology and Life Sciences, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University, Pátkova 2137/5, 182 00 Prague 8 - Libeň, Czech Republic.

477,The association between high-normal blood pressure and the development of preeclampsia in twin pregnancies,"Objective: We sought to determine if women with twin pregnancies and blood pressure (BP) above the 95th percentile but within normal ranges (i.e. less than 140 systolic and 90 diastolic) are at increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of all women with twin pregnancies being cared for by a single Maternal Fetal Medicine practice between 2012 and 2018. We identified all women who had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above the 95th percentile but less than 140 systolic and 90 diastolic at any point during pregnancy. Based on prior publications, the 95th percentile was defined as: a SBP 121-139 mmHg up to 30 weeks or 131-139 mmHg after 30 weeks, a DBP 81-89 mmHg up to 34 weeks or 85-89 mmHg after 34 weeks. We excluded women diagnosed with chronic hypertension either before or during pregnancy. The primary outcome was the development of preeclampsia. Chi-square and logistic regression were used.Results: A total of 457 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 109 (23.9%) had either a systolic or diastolic BP above the 95th percentile (but normal) at any time during pregnancy. These women were significantly more likely to develop preeclampsia (30.3 versus 12.6%, p < .001, aOR 2.32 (1.31, 4.09)) and gestational hypertension without preeclampsia (16.5 versus 4.6%, p < .001, aOR 4.27 (2.01, 9.07)).Conclusions: In women with twin pregnancies, a high-normal systolic or diastolic BP (above 120 systolic or 80 diastolic prior to 30 weeks, or above 130 systolic or 84 diastolic after 30 weeks) is associated with a significantly increased risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 2 Maternal Fetal Medicine Associates, PLLC, New York, NY, USA.","Nathan S Fox , Melissa B Hill , Courtney T Connolly , Rebecca A Klahr , Kelly B Zafman , Andrei Rebarber ",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,2021 Jan,"Blood Pressure,Female,Humans,Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced*,Pre-Eclampsia* / epidemiology,Pre-Eclampsia* / etiology,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30961410

480,Prevalence of unintended pregnancy and its associated factors: Evidence from six south Asian countries,"Aim: Unintended pregnancy is a significant public health concern in South Asian countries because of its negative association with the socioeconomic and health outcomes for both children and mothers. The present study aimed to explore the prevalence of unintended pregnancy and explore its determinants among women of reproductive age in six South Asian countries. Methods: Nationwide latest demography and health survey data from six South Asian countries, including Bangladesh (2014), Pakistan (2017-2018), Nepal (2016), Afghanistan (2015), Maldives (2016-2017) and India (2015-2016) were pooled for the present study. Multivariate analysis was performed to explore the association between unintended pregnancy and its associated factors. Results: Amongst the total women (n = 41,689), overall, 19.1% pregnancies were reported as unintended (ranging from 11.9% in India to 28.4% in Bangladesh). The logistic regression model showed that younger women (15-19 years) had 1.42 times higher chance of unintended pregnancies. The odds of unintended pregnancies was 1.24 times higher for poorest women and 1.19 times higher for poorer women. Further, urban women (aOR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50-0.80), women having no children (aOR = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.09-0.12), smaller (≤4) family (aOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.67-0.78), those who intent to use contraceptive (aOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.60-0.86), currently living with partner (aOR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81-0.99), first cohabitation in teenage (≤19 years) (aOR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78-0.92) were less likely to report unintended pregnancies. Conclusions: This study has showed that women's age, wealth index, place of residence, number of children, family size, the intention of contraceptive use, living with a partner, and first cohabitation age are essential determinants of unintended pregnancy. These factors should be considered when trying to reduce unintended pregnancy in six South Asian countries. However, there is a need to improve health education, counselling, skills-building, sex education, modern contraceptive use and its access in this region. Intervention programs regarding reproductive health and policies are warranted to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy in South Asian countries.","Affiliations 1 Statistics Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh. 2 Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN), School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia.","Alamgir Sarder , Sheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam , Maniruzzaman , Ashis Talukder , Benojir Ahammed ",PLoS One,2021 Feb 1,"Adolescent,Adult,Asia,Female,Humans,Logistic Models,Middle Aged,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned*,Prevalence,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33524018
481,Facilitators and barriers to the clinical administration of herbal medicine in Ghana: a qualitative study,"Background: Herbal medicine administration in conventional health care services is gaining popularity lately. Much has not been documented on the perceived enhancers and challenges to herbal medicine administration at the hospital. The study sought to explore the facilitators and barriers to the clinical administration of herbal medicine in Ghana. Method: Qualitative descriptive exploratory design was employed. Fourteen participants among the consented and purposively sampled nurses were interviewed. Data was transcribed and analysed using content analysis. Results: The participants disclosed that facilitators to the clinical administration of herbal medicine include doctors' prescription, affordability of herbal medications by patients, patients' willingness to use herbal medicine and availability of herbal medicine. Barriers to the clinical administration of herbal medicine were inadequate knowledge on herbal medicine, lack of publicity, unclear integration, lack of collaboration and policies on herbal medicine administration at the hospital. Other barriers were negative mindset of patients and lack of national health insurance scheme (NHIS) coverage. Conclusion: Clinical administration of herbal medicine is faced with an array of challenges. Doctor's prescription, nursing education on herbal medicine and NHIS coverage of herbal medicine are imperative to improve herbal medicine administration in hospitals. Herbal medicine addition into mainstream health care services is surging high in many countries. This study aimed at finding out what nurses consider as the issues that make it easy or difficult to serve herbal medicine in the hospital. Qualitative method was employed, in-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted and data collected was typed verbatim. The typed data was content analysed and findings supported with the nurses' statements. The findings of the study showed that facilitators to the clinical use of herbal medicine include doctors' prescription, affordability of the herbal drug, patient's willingness to use the herbal medication, patient's belief about herbal medicine and availability of herbal medicine. Challenges to the clinical use of herbal medicine disclosed were lack of knowledge on herbal medicine, lack of publicity, unclear integration, lack of collaboration between health professionals and herbal medicine providers. Other barriers include negative mindset of patients and lack of national health insurance (NHIS) coverage. The researchers came to a consensus that nurses need further training on herbal medicine to enhance herbal medicine use at the hospital. Health professionals need to collaborate with herbal medicine service providers and NHIS must be reviewed to cover herbal medications.","Affiliations 1 School of Nursing, Wisconsin International University College.

482,Vasa previa: Perinatal outcomes in singleton and multiple pregnancies,"Vasa previa (VP) is a rare and life-threatening condition for the fetus. It is associated with increased perinatal mortality rates. The current study sought to retrospectively analyze the perinatal outcomes of VP in singleton and multiple pregnancies between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2019 at a tertiary hospital in west China. One hundred and fifty-seven cases of VP were identified, including 131 singletons, 23 twins and 3 triplets. VP in 20 cases was diagnosed at delivery. There were 183 live births. Neonatal mortality was significantly higher in cases with no prenatal diagnosis (9.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.035). There was a significantly higher rate of NICU admission, premature infant and neonatal pneumonia in cases with prenatal diagnosis (p < 0.05). Among twin pregnancies with VP as a prenatal diagnosis, there were significantly earlier gestational age at admission (31.1 vs. 34.1 weeks, p = 0.000) and delivery age (33.4 vs. 35.3 weeks, p = 0.000) than those among singleton pregnancies. The neonatal mortality in twins with prenatal diagnosis was significantly higher than that in singletons (0% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.037). Early hospitalization of VP in the third trimester may be reasonable. The data suggest that the timing of elective delivery at 34-36 weeks in singletons and 32-34 weeks in twins may be suitable. It should be emphasized to make corresponding optimal delivery time according to individual differences for the women, especially in twin pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University; Chengdu, China. 2 Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, Chengdu, China.","Na Liu , Qing Hu , Hua Liao , Xiaodong Wang , Haiyan Yu ",Biosci Trends,2021 May 11,"Adult,Cesarean Section,China / epidemiology,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Male,Maternal Age,Perinatal Mortality*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Triplet / statistics & numerical data*,Pregnancy, Twin / statistics & numerical data*,Retrospective Studies,Tertiary Care Centers / statistics & numerical data,Ultrasonography, Prenatal / statistics & numerical data,Vasa Previa / diagnosis,Vasa Previa / epidemiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33746156

484,The implications of parent mental health and wellbeing for parent-child attachment: A systematic review,"Background: Parent mental health and wellbeing may have implications for understanding attachment transmission. In this systematic review, we synthesise the published literature to determine the nature of the relationship between parent mental health and wellbeing and the intergenerational transmission of attachment and to provide recommendations for future research, clinical practice and intervention. Method: Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach, five electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies, published in English. Articles were considered for inclusion if data was collected on adult attachment, child attachment, and a domain of parent mental health/wellbeing. No date parameters were applied to the search strategy. The review was registered with PROPSERO (registration number: CRD42020157247). Results: Eleven studies examining the impact on parent mental health and wellbeing on the intergenerational transmission of attachment were identified for inclusion in this review. Our review found preliminary evidence that parent mental health and wellbeing play a role in the intergenerational transmission of attachment. Other key findings from the review were: evidence quality is mixed due to variable measurement of attachment and mental health; studies have mostly included correlational analysis or do not utilise contemporary methodological approaches to testing mediating or moderating relationships; and literature is largely focused on psychopathology and negative factors of mental health. Conclusions: The limited scope of parent mental health and wellbeing constructs examined in the literature, the sparse use of robust statistical analyses, and the lack of literature in general makes it difficult to draw conclusions on how and why parent mental health impacts attachment transmission. Addressing these limitations will further progress attachment-related literature and may have particular implications for attachment-informed interventions with clinical populations.","Affiliations 1 School of Psychology and Early Start, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. 2 School of Psychology, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.","Alixandra Risi , Judy A Pickard , Amy L Bird ",PLoS One,2021 Dec 16,"Systematic Review,Child,Humans,Mental Health / standards*,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914730

Methods: The correlational study was conducted at the Lahore Garrison University, Lahore, Pakistan, from September 2017 to March 2018, and comprised an equal number of children from single-parent families and those living with both the parents. Data was collected using the parental authority questionnaire and the Urdu version of the inventory of parental and peer attachment. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. Results: Of the 200 children, 100(50%) were in each of the two groups, and both the groups had 50(50%) girls and boys each. The overall mean age of the sample was 14.56±3.03 years (range: 11-18 years). There was a significant negative correlation between permissive parenting styles with mother's communication (p<0.05); authoritarian parenting style had negative correlation with parental communication and trust(p<0.001). Authoritative parenting had significant positive relationship with trust (p<0.001), and communication with parents (p<0.001), and there was negative relationship between authoritative parenting with feeling alienated from parents (p<0.01). Single-parent children perceived their parents as authoritarian (p<0.001) and had more alienated attachment with parents (p<0.001), whereas children living with both the parents had more trust (p<0.001) and had better communication with their parents (p<0.001). Conclusions: It is important to understand the role of parents and different parenting styles in building up strong parentchild attachment.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychology, Lahore Garrison University, Lahore, Pakistan.","Mehr-Un-Nisa Idrees , Syeda Mehreen Zahra , Fatima Naeem ",J Pak Med Assoc,2021 Jun,"Adolescent,Child,Female,Humans,Male,Pakistan,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents*,Permissiveness,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34111068
486,The importance of specialized sleep investigations in children with a suprasellar tumor,"Purpose: Disruption of sleep has great impact on quality of life. In children with a suprasellar tumor and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, the circadian rhythm may be disturbed causing sleep problems. However, also other factors may influence sleep. Awareness of these different etiologies and careful history taking with appropriate additional diagnostics will aid in restoring sleep quality. Methods: We present the workup of 4 cases with a suprasellar tumor and disturbances of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, and daytime sleepiness. In parallel, we developed a flowchart, to aid clinicians in the diagnostics of sleep problems in children after treatment for a (supra) sellar brain tumor. Results: All four patients, known with hypopituitarism, presented with sleep complaints and increased daytime sleepiness. In all four, the cause of sleep problems showed to be different. In the first case, sleep evaluation revealed a severe obstructive sleep apnea, whereupon nocturnal ventilation was started. The second case revealed poor sleep hygiene in combination with an obsessive compulsive disorder. Sleep hygiene was addressed and psychiatric consultation was offered. Dexamphetamine treatment was started to reduce her obsessive compulsive complaints. The third case showed a delayed sleep phase syndrome, which improved by educational support. The fourth case revealed a secondary organic hypersomnia for which modafinil treatment was started. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances in children with hypopituitarism due to a (supra) sellar tumor can have different entities which require specific therapy. Awareness of these different entities is important to enable appropriate counseling. Referral to an expertise sleep center may be advised, if standard educational support is insufficient.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Wilhelmina Children Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Lundlaan 6, Utrecht, 3584 EA, The Netherlands. j.vanschaik-3@umcutrecht.nl. 2 Department of Sleep Medicine, Kempenhaeghe Expertise Center for Epileptology, Sleep Medicine and Neurocognition, Heeze, The Netherlands. 3 Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands. 4 Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 5 Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Wilhelmina Children Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, Lundlaan 6, Utrecht, 3584 EA, The Netherlands.","J van Schaik , S Pillen , R R L van Litsenburg , N L E Vandenbussche , J M de Bont , A Y N Schouten-van Meeteren , H M van Santen ",Pituitary,2020 Dec,"Case Reports,Adolescent,Brain Neoplasms / drug therapy,Brain Neoplasms / physiopathology*,Child,Circadian Rhythm / drug effects,Circadian Rhythm / physiology*,Dextroamphetamine / therapeutic use,Female,Humans,Male,Sleep / drug effects,Sleep / physiology*,Dextroamphetamine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32691357
487,"Nutritional interventions for reducing the signs and symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage and accelerate recovery in athletes: current knowledge, practical application and future perspectives","Purpose: This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the nutritional strategies to treat the signs and symptoms related to EIMD. These strategies have been organized into the following sections based upon the quality and quantity of the scientific support available: (1) interventions with a good level of evidence; (2) interventions with some evidence and require more research; and (3) potential nutritional interventions with little to-no-evidence to support efficacy. Method: Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science were used. The search terms 'EIMD' and 'exercise-induced muscle damage' were individually concatenated with 'supplementation', 'athletes', 'recovery', 'adaptation', 'nutritional strategies', hormesis'. Result: Supplementation with tart cherries, beetroot, pomegranate, creatine monohydrate and vitamin D appear to provide a prophylactic effect in reducing EIMD. β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, and the ingestion of protein, BCAA and milk could represent promising strategies to manage EIMD. Other nutritional interventions were identified but offered limited effect in the treatment of EIMD; however, inconsistencies in the dose and frequency of interventions might account for the lack of consensus regarding their efficacy. Conclusion: There are clearly varying levels of evidence and practitioners should be mindful to refer to this evidence-base when prescribing to clients and athletes. One concern is the potential for these interventions to interfere with the exercise-recovery-adaptation continuum. Whilst there is no evidence that these interventions will blunt adaptation, it seems pragmatic to use a periodised approach to administering these strategies until data are in place to provide and evidence base on any interference effect on adaptation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Health, Performance and Recovery, Parma Calcio 1913, Parma, Italy. tindaro.bongiovanni@gmail.com. 2 Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, Università Degli Studi Di Milano, Milano, Italy. tindaro.bongiovanni@gmail.com. 3 Medical Department Manchester City Football Club, Manchester, UK. 4 Nutrition Department Liverpool Football Club, Liverpool, UK. 5 Centre for Elite Performance, French Football Federation, 75015, Paris, France. 6 Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, Università Degli Studi Di Milano, Milano, Italy. 7 Department of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 8 Water Research Group, North West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa.","Tindaro Bongiovanni , Federico Genovesi , Monika Nemmer , Christopher Carling , Giampietro Alberti , Glyn Howatson ",Eur J Appl Physiol,2020 Sep,"Review,Adaptation, Physiological / physiology,Athletes,Exercise / physiology*,Humans,Muscle, Skeletal / physiopathology*,Muscular Diseases / physiopathology*,Nutritional Status / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661771

489,Prevalence of Extraplacental Anastomoses in Monochorionic Twin Pregnancies,Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of extraplacental anastomoses (EPA) and the factors associated. Methods: A retrospective study including 144 placentas from monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins delivering at one institution was performed. EPA were defined as any intertwin anastomosis located outside the chorionic plate on macroscopic inspection. The association with perinatal factors and with umbilical cord insertion site was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of EPA was 4.9% (7/144). Velamentous cord insertion of both twins was significantly associated with the presence of EPA in the multivariate logistic regression model (p = 0.045). Discussion: EPA was found in ≈5% of MCDA twin pregnancies.,"Affiliations 1 Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Osaka, Japan, yamaryo@wch.opho.jp. 2 Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Osaka, Japan.","Ryo Yamamoto , Kentaro Nakanishi , Haruna Kawaguchi , Shusaku Hayashi , Keisuke Ishii ",Fetal Diagn Ther,2021,"Female,Fetofetal Transfusion*,Humans,Placenta,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin*,Prevalence,Retrospective Studies,Twins, Monozygotic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33059349
490,Psychological needs in parents and clinically referred adolescents: An integrative model via parenting and parental mindfulness,"Framed on Self-Determination Theory, this study sought to examine the interplay between parents' and adolescents' need satisfaction and need frustration, as well as to investigate the potential mediating role of autonomy-supportive and psychologically controlling parenting. Whether parents' dispositional mindfulness moderated the relation between parental need frustration and parenting was also investigated. Participants were 213 clinically referred adolescents between 12 and 17 years (Mage = 14.36; 55.9% girls) and 225 parents (85.3% mothers). Findings from structural equation models revealed a bright and a dark pathway linking parents' and adolescents' need-based experiences through parenting. Specifically, parental need satisfaction was positively related to autonomy-supportive parenting, which, in turn, contributed to greater adolescents' need satisfaction. In contrast, parents' need frustration yielded a positive association with psychologically controlling parenting, which, in turn, positively related to adolescents' need frustration. Latent moderation analyses also indicated that parents' mindfulness played a role as a moderator of the relationship between parental need frustration and psychological control; the association was attenuated when parents reported higher levels of mindfulness. Implications for the promotion of positive parenting among families of adolescents with mental health problems are outlined.

491,Quality of Online Information Regarding High-Risk Pregnancies,"Health information on the Internet can have a direct effect on healthcare decision-making. However, the quality of information online has seldom been evaluated. This study aimed to assess the quality of online information on high-risk pregnancies provided by English and Korean Web sites. Through a Google search, 30 English and 30 Korean Web sites were selected on January 2 and 3, 2020, respectively, and assessed using DISCERN, a Journal of the American Medical Association, and Health On the Net Foundation code questionnaires. The data assessed were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistical tests. Overall, the information provided by the English Web sites presented higher-quality information than the Korean Web sites. Most Web sites did not provide the sources of the information presented on their Web sites, meet the Journal of the American Medical Association criteria, or provide information on complementarity. Based on our results, nurses need to be competent in assessing the quality of Web sites and the health information presented there, and nursing students need to be prepared to do so as well. Nurses are responsible for educating their patients about the possibility of incorrect information provided by Internet Web sites and informing their patients about reliable Web sites, thus assisting them to make informed decisions regarding their health.","Affiliation 1 Author Affiliations: Department of Nursing, Chosun University (Dr S.-Y.

492,The Good Enough Parenting early intervention schema therapy based program: Participant experience,"Background and objectives: Schema therapy (ST) has become a mainstream therapy for the treatment of psychopathology and has been validated through a series of large scale, international randomized control trials. Among other things, schema therapy emphasizes the meeting of core emotional needs in children by primary caregivers as these unmet needs continue to adversely affect their lives into adulthood. An early intervention parenting program has been developed to help parents meet these core emotional needs in order to prevent the development of psychopathology in the first place. The program, Good Enough Parenting, is equally focused on reducing problems and strengthening parenting practices, regardless of where the child is on the ""disordered to well-being continuum"". This study aims to explore ""patient experience"" by users of this program. Best clinical research guidelines advocate that participants should be used as collaborators rather than pure recipients; this process should predate large scale trials. Design: An exploratory qualitative study with 55 parent-participants of Good Enough Parenting was conducted. Methods: One-to-one interviews were conducted with participants, using critical incident technique and guided by semi-structured interview schedule, to explore their experiences with the program. Transcripts were then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Coding showed a high degree of inter-rater reliability (kappa value of 0.78). The themes that emerged were Cultivating Awareness of Parents' Own Schemas, Cultivating Intentionality, Working through Developmental Issues, Responses to Challenges at Home, Performing Multiple Roles, and the Learning Process. Participants overwhelmingly reported satisfaction within these key themes. Conclusions: The results support the development of the program and the choice of ""participant reported outcome measures"" for use in subsequent randomized controlled trials.","Affiliations 1 Persatuan Kebajikan HOPE Worldwide Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 2 HOPE Worldwide Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. 3 James Cook University, Singapore, Singapore. 4 Schema Therapy Institute Midwest, Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States of America.","John Philip Louis , Vida Ortiz , Joanna Barlas , Joyce Sue Lee , George Lockwood , Wayne Freeman Chong , Karen McDonald Louis , Patricia Sim ",PLoS One,2021 Jan 22,"Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Schema Therapy*,Singapore",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33481822
493,DeepSleepNet-Lite: A Simplified Automatic Sleep Stage Scoring Model With Uncertainty Estimates,"Deep learning is widely used in the most recent automatic sleep scoring algorithms. Its popularity stems from its excellent performance and from its ability to process raw signals and to learn feature directly from the data. Most of the existing scoring algorithms exploit very computationally demanding architectures, due to their high number of training parameters, and process lengthy time sequences in input (up to 12 minutes). Only few of these architectures provide an estimate of the model uncertainty. In this study we propose DeepSleepNet-Lite, a simplified and lightweight scoring architecture, processing only 90-seconds EEG input sequences. We exploit, for the first time in sleep scoring, the Monte Carlo dropout technique to enhance the performance of the architecture and to also detect the uncertain instances. The evaluation is performed on a single-channel EEG Fpz-Cz from the open source Sleep-EDF expanded database. DeepSleepNet-Lite achieves slightly lower performance, if not on par, compared to the existing state-of-the-art architectures, in overall accuracy, macro F1-score and Cohen's kappa (on Sleep-EDF v1-2013 ±30mins: 84.0%, 78.0%, 0.78; on Sleep-EDF v2-2018 ±30mins: 80.3%, 75.2%, 0.73). Monte Carlo dropout enables the estimate of the uncertain predictions. By rejecting the uncertain instances, the model achieves higher performance on both versions of the database (on Sleep-EDF v1-2013 ±30mins: 86.1.0%, 79.6%, 0.81; on Sleep-EDF v2-2018 ±30mins: 82.3%, 76.7%, 0.76).

494,Habitual sleep duration affects recovery from acute sleep deprivation: A modeling study,"Adult humans exhibit high interindividual variation in habitual sleep durations, with short sleepers typically sleeping less than 6 h per night and long sleepers typically sleeping more than 9 h per night. Analysis of the time course of homeostatic sleep drive in habitual short and long sleepers has not identified differences between these groups, leading to the hypothesis that habitual short sleep results from increased tolerance to high levels of homeostatic sleep drive. Using a physiologically-based mathematical model of the sleep-wake regulatory network, we investigate responses to acute sleep deprivation in simulated populations of habitual long, regular and short sleepers that differ in daily levels of homeostatic sleep drive. The model predicts timing and durations of wake, rapid eye movement (REM), and non-REM (NREM) sleep episodes as modulated by the homeostatic sleep drive and the circadian rhythm, which is entrained to an external light cycle. Model parameters are fit to experimental measures of baseline sleep durations to construct simulated populations of individuals of each sleeper type. The simulated populations are validated against data for responses to specific acute sleep deprivation protocols. We use the model to predict responses to a wide range of sleep deprivation durations for each sleeper type. Model results predict that all sleeper types exhibit shorter sleep durations during recovery sleep that occurs in the morning, but, for recovery sleep times occurring later in the day, long and regular sleepers show longer and more variable sleep durations, and can suffer longer lasting disruption of daily sleep patterns compared to short sleepers. Additionally, short sleepers showed more resilience to sleep deprivation with longer durations of waking episodes following recovery sleep. These results support the hypothesis that differential responses to sleep deprivation between short and long sleepers result from differences in the tolerance for homeostatic sleep pressure.","Affiliations 1 Department of Mathematics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

496,Causal assessment of sleep on coronary heart disease,"Objective: Sleep is an essential physiological process that protects our physical and mental health. However, the causality of the association between sleep and coronary heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Mendelian randomization (MR), using genetic variants as instrumental variables to test for causality, can infer credible causal associations. We applied a two-sample MR framework to determine the causal association between sleep (sleeplessness, sleep duration, and daytime dozing) and CHD by integrating summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Methods: Data included in this study were the GWAS summary statistics datasets from the C4D Consortium for CHD; Neale Lab UKB-a:13 Consortium for sleeplessness; Neale Lab UKB-a:9 Consortium for sleep duration and Neale Lab UKB-a:15 Consortium for daytime dozing. The conventional MR approach (inverse variance weighted, IVW) method and Egger method were used. Heterogeneity was calculated using each of the different MR methods where possible. Horizontal pleiotropy was evaluated by p-value of the MR-Egger intercept. Results: The IVW method estimate indicated that the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval, CI) for CHD was 3.924 (1.345-11.447) per standard deviation increase in sleeplessness (p = 0.012). Results were consistent in MR-Egger method (OR, 4.654; 95% CI, 1.191-18.186; p = 0.009). The genetically predicted sleeplessness was positively casually associated with CHD. The causal association between sleep duration (or daytime dozing) and CHD was not established. Conclusion: Our analysis provided evidence supporting a causal relationship between sleeplessness (not sleep duration or daytime dozing) and CHD.","Affiliations 1 Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, GuangDong, PR China; Guangdong Engineering Research Center for Light and Health, Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou, GuangDong, PR China. 2 The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, 58 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yue Xiu, GuangZhou, 510080, GuangDong, PR China. 3 The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, 58 Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yue Xiu, GuangZhou, 510080, GuangDong, PR China.

497,Esssential thrombocythaemia and pregnancy-A need for prospective study and a consensus on its management,"MPN are rare diseases, however young women with ET are increasingly being recognised. Management during pregnancy is often a recognised issue with no clear guidelines for management. Pregnancy is associated with considerable risk of complications and therefore warrants a multidisciplinary approach and early identification of high-risk pregnancies. Robust data is limited and therefore we advocate for more prospective (cohort and registry), multicentre, collaborative efforts to gather meaningful information about risk, and risk-adapted therapy, to guide management. The commentary reviews the study by How et al and compares the observations to other studies around the world. It recognises that previous pregnancies with complications increase the risk of further complications during future pregnancies. It is important to recognise the high-risk pregnancies and have a risk adapted approach to the same. The use of low dose aspirin is recommended throughout the pregnancy. The use of LMWH prophylaxis antepartum should be individualised to the thrombotic risk status and applied post-partum for at least 6 weeks. Interferon a remains the safest and effective approach for cytoreductive therapy. Collaborative expert efforts world-wide, as well as larger prospective trials and registry data, will enhance our knowledge to formulate standard guidelines for these group of patients.","Affiliations 1 Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia. 2 Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, Victoria, 3000, Australia.

Based on interviews with 16 purposively sampled parents, thematic analysis revealed themes concerning the parents' acknowledgment of stressful events and their emotional reactions, meanings of their experiences constructed through causal connections, and outcomes of their perceived improvement in self-understanding, parent-child relationships, and philosophies on life. Largely consistent with this theoretical model, such findings highlight the uniqueness of the personal growth process of parents of children with ASD in China's sociocultural context.","Affiliations 1 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territory, Hong Kong. xiaoyuliu@cuhk.edu.hk. 2 Chung Chi College, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Rm. 613, Sino Building, Sha Tin, New Territory, Hong Kong. xiaoyuliu@cuhk.edu.hk. 3 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territory, Hong Kong.","Xiao-Yu Liu , Siu-Ming To ",J Autism Dev Disord,2021 Jun,"Adult,Autism Spectrum Disorder / psychology,Autism Spectrum Disorder / therapy*,Behavior Therapy*,Child,Child, Preschool,China,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Psychotherapeutic Processes,Qualitative Research",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32875454
499,Nomograms for predicting adverse obstetric outcome in IVF pregnancy: A preliminary study,"Background: In a previous study, we showed that the obstetric complication rate after in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy was 40%. The main objective of our study was to determine maternal prognosis factors that influence the IVF pregnancy outcome. Methods: We conducted an observational retrospective monocentric study between January 2014 and January 2018. Pregnancy over 22 gestational weeks (GW) obtained after IVF in our infertility clinic was included. Maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcome were collected. Results: Data from 498 IVF pregnancies were analyzed. The most significant maternal prognosis factors for obstetric complications were maternal age above 40 years (OR 3,0 [95% IC 1,30-7,09], P = 0,010), twin pregnancies (3.8 [95% IC 1.49-9.99], P = .005), daily maternal smoking above 10 cigarettes (7.1 [95% IC 1.22-41.74], P = .029), maternal obesity (2.2 [95% IC 1.19-4.07], P = .012), endometriosis stages III and IV (6.4 [95% IC 1.52-27.04], P = .011), and history of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in early pregnancy (5.7 [95% IC 1.29-24.74], P = .021). Risk increase was independent of pregnancy type (singleton or twin) and allowed the elaboration of 2 nomograms. Conclusions: Our study showed a link between some maternal factors and increase in obstetric complications after IVF. Screening of these factors during preconceptional visit is essential to identify at high-risk pregnancies and adapt their monitoring.","Affiliations 1 Ecole Universitaire de Maïeutique de Marseille Méditerranée (EU3M), Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France. 2 Department of Gynecology-Obstetric and Reproductive Medicine, AP-HM, Hôpital La Conception, Marseille, France. 3 Public Heath Department, Aix-Marseille Université, Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux Marseille and Aix-Marseille Univ, Marseille, France. 4 CNRS, IRD, IMBE, Avignon Université, Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France.","Alice Portal , Claire Sunyach , Anderson Loundou , Odile Lacroix-Paulmye , Jeanne Perrin , Blandline Courbiere ",Birth,2021 Jun,"Observational Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Female,Fertilization in Vitro*,Humans,Nomograms*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Pregnancy, Twin,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33529415
500,Association between low fetal fraction and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in in vitro fertilization-conceived pregnancies,"Background: Fetal fraction from noninvasive prenatal screening has been used as a predictive marker for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in spontaneous pregnancies. Objective: We aimed to determine whether fetal fraction from noninvasive prenatal screening predicts hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in pregnancies conceived by assisted reproductive technology, stratified by fresh and frozen embryo transfer. Study design: Retrospective cohort study of women with singleton pregnancies who underwent fresh or frozen embryo transfer, had noninvasive prenatal screening, and had a live birth >20 weeks at a single institution from 2013 to 2019. Women with major anomalies, nonreportable noninvasive prenatal screening, or chronic hypertension were excluded. Fetal fraction was corrected for gestational age, noninvasive prenatal screening platform, and defined as low if it is less than fifth percentile for the study population. The primary outcome was hypertensive disorders of pregnancy during delivery hospitalization, stratified by fresh vs frozen embryo transfer. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine whether low fetal fraction predicts hypertensive disorders of pregnancy for fresh and frozen embryo transfer, controlling for age, prepregnancy body mass index, heparin use, low-dose aspirin use, estradiol level if fresh embryo transfer, and trophectoderm biopsy and cycle type if frozen embryo transfer. Results: We included 81 women with low fetal fraction and 847 women with normal fetal fraction. The adjusted prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in women with low fetal fraction was 24.9% in fresh embryo transfer and 34.5% in frozen embryo transfer. In fresh embryo transfer pregnancies, the odds of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were higher among women with low fetal fraction (adjusted odds ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-5.30; P=.026). In frozen embryo transfer pregnancies, there was no association between low fetal fraction and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-2.88; P=.321). Conclusion: Low fetal fraction is associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in women who conceive by fresh embryo transfer. Fetal fraction may represent a clinically useful marker for screening for hypertension and allow clinicians to target risk reduction strategies, such as low-dose aspirin, in pregnancies conceived by fresh embryo transfer.","Affiliations 1 Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Drs Cagino, McCarter, and Prabhu).

501,The Association between Gestational Weight Gain in Each Trimester and Pregnancy Outcomes in Twin Pregnancies,"Objective: Adequate maternal weight gain in twin pregnancies is associated with improved outcomes such as increased fetal growth and decreased incidence of preterm birth. However, it remains unclear when gestational weight gain has the greatest influence on pregnancy outcomes. Our objective was to identify at which time in a twin pregnancy does inadequate maternal weight gain have the greatest association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study of women with twin pregnancies and normal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) who delivered at ≥24 weeks' gestation by a single maternal-fetal medicine practice between 2005 and 2017. Baseline characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between women with and without adequate average gestational weight gain (weight gain per week based on the 2009 Institute of Medicine recommendations). This analysis was performed for weight gain over the entire pregnancy, as well as from 0 to 16, 16 to 24, and 24 weeks to delivery. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to control for potential confounding variables. Results: A total of 609 women with twin pregnancies and normal prepregnancy BMI were included, of whom 386 (63.4%) had adequate average gestational weight gain over the entire pregnancy and 223 (36.6%) did not. Inadequate average gestational weight gain between 0 and 16 weeks' gestation was associated with a higher incidence of birthweight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-2.51) and less than the 5th percentile for gestational age (aOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.29-3.40). Inadequate gestational weight gain between 16 and 24 weeks was associated with lower birthweight of the larger twin (β: -0.09; p = 0.04). Inadequate weight gain from 24 weeks to delivery was associated with spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks' gestation (aOR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.13-2.47), <34 weeks' gestation (aOR: 4.32; 95% CI: 2.45-7.63), <32 weeks' gestation (aOR: 9.07; 95% CI: 3.66-22.48), and a lower incidence of preeclampsia (aOR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.16-0.63). Conclusion: In twin pregnancies, gestational weight gain between 0 and 16 weeks as well as between 16 and 24 weeks is most associated with fetal growth, whereas gestational weight gain after 24 weeks is most associated with preterm birth. This may help elucidate the mechanism of action of the impact of gestational weight gain in twin pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York. 2 Maternal Fetal Medicine Associates, New York, New York.","Lilly Y Liu , Kelly B Zafman , Nathan S Fox ",Am J Perinatol,2021 May,"Adult,Body Mass Index,Female,Gestational Weight Gain / physiology*,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / epidemiology,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology*,Pregnancy Trimesters / physiology*,Pregnancy, Twin / physiology*,Premature Birth / epidemiology,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31958859

An additional search was performed in Google Scholar. All published materials were in English. Several ocular symptoms and disorders, including conjunctival cicatrization, symblepharon formation, obliteration of the fornices and the canaliculi, keratinization of the cornea, dryness, central corneal thinning, and corneal epithelial defect, have been associated with the use of traditional herbal medicine. In addition, the use of traditional eye medicine may result in corneal edema, opacity, ulceration, and perforation. Early recognition of ocular injuries could avoid or at least delay long-term sequelae. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the side effects of traditional remedies. Furthermore, public education, early detection of symptoms, and timely intervention may prevent permanent damage to the eyes.","Affiliation 1 Department of Emergency, King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.","Huda Al-Ghadeer , Mohammed Al-Amry ",Middle East Afr J Ophthalmol,2021 Sep 25,"Review,Eye Injuries*,Herbal Medicine*,Humans,Medicine, Traditional,Saudi Arabia,Vision Disorders",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34759672

Design: Mixed-methods e-survey. Methods: The survey link was distributed through professional associations and social media. Quantitative data were descriptively summarised and qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results: Results from 59 responses indicated a profound effect of the pandemic on herbal medicine practice, with a move to remote working and a reduction in client numbers. Practitioners reported prescribing a wide range of medicinal plants, chiefly Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Echinacea spp. alongside providing information and advice. Few reported inter-professional collaboration. Conclusions: Herbal practitioners need to build on current collaborations, research and experience to develop consistent approaches to support people with mild-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. More systematic exploration of herbal medicine practice during and as a consequence of the pandemic is needed. What is already known about the topic: • The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on all types of healthcare• The impact on herbal medicine practice is unclear.

504,Mental Health of Canadian Firefighters: The Impact of Sleep,"Volunteer and career firefighters are at risk of major depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol use disorder, and other mental health disorders due to the demanding and unpredictable nature of their employment. The mental health risks are exacerbated by the need to work extended hours, night shifts, and/or rotating schedules, or the competing demands of other employment, especially in volunteer firefighters. The mental health disorders and risk factors interact with altered sleeping patterns. In the current study, we examined volunteer and career firefighters regarding the association between mental health and sleep, drawing from a national Canadian mental health survey of 1217 firefighters. Most (69%) of the firefighters reported less than ideal sleep quality and 21% screened positive for clinical insomnia, with no significant difference between volunteer and career subgroups. Firefighters with insomnia had higher odds ratios (OR) and frequencies for PTSD (OR = 4.98), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 7.15), panic disorder (OR = 6.88), social phobia (OR = 4.98), and major depressive disorder (OR = 7.91), than firefighters without insomnia. The burden of sleep disorders and their association with mental health disorders suggests that sleep should be considered in health monitoring and self-management, environmental design, fire service work-organization policies, and health programming.","Affiliations 1 School of Rehabilitation Therapy, Queen's University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. 2 Department of Psychology, University of Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada. 3 Department of Psychiatry, Queen's University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada. 4 Department of Sociology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL A1C 5S7, Canada. 5 School of Physical Therapy and Surgery, Western University, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada. 6 Kingston Fire & Rescue, Kingston, ON K7P 1N3, Canada.","Heidi Cramm , Rachel Richmond , Laleh Jamshidi , Megan Edgelow , Dianne Groll , Rose Ricciardelli , Joy Christine MacDermid , Michael Keiley , R Nicholas Carleton ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Dec 16,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Canada / epidemiology,Depressive Disorder, Major*,Firefighters*,Humans,Mental Health,Sleep,Sleep Quality",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948864
505,"Parental Empathy, Aggressive Parenting, and Child Adjustment in a Noncustodial High-Risk Sample","This study examined the relations between parental empathy, parenting physical aggression, parental psychological control, and child adjustment in a sample of parents who had their children removed from their custody because of child abuse or neglect. Twenty parents between 24 and 40 years of age (M = 31.15, SD = 4.85; 85% female) with a child aged between 1.5 and 16 years (M = 6.5, SD = 3.88; 70% boys) participated in the study. Our sample was comprised of relatively racially diverse and low-income parents, with 40% from racial minority groups and 70% below the poverty line. Parents were recruited from a local nonprofit organization providing court-mandated parenting classes. Parents reported on their dispositional empathy, physical aggression toward children, psychological control and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms in an interview format. Parents also reported on empathy for their children through a semistructured interview; their empathy was later coded by trained research assistants. Bivariate correlation analyses revealed that parental empathy in the parent-child relationship negatively correlated with parental psychological control. Greater parental psychological control significantly correlated with greater approval of corporal punishment. Moreover, in the subsample of older children (6 years old and above), greater parental dispositional empathy was associated with greater child externalizing symptoms. Further exploratory analyses showed that associations between parental empathy, psychological control, and spanking attitudes differed across parents of boys and of girls. This study highlights the importance of examining empathy specific to the parent-child relationship in addition to dispositional empathy to predict parenting aggression. More importantly, studies should focus on a more covert form of parenting aggression, parental psychological control, in addition to physical aggression.","Affiliations 1 Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou, China. 2 University of Kentucky, Lexington, USA.","Shuang Bi , Peggy S Keller ",J Interpers Violence,2021 Oct,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Adolescent,Aggression*,Child,Child, Preschool,Empathy,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31422750
506,Clinical outcomes in chronic intervillositis of unknown etiology,"Introduction: Chronic intervillositis of unknown etiology (CIUE) is a histopathological lesion of the placenta that is frequently accompanied by unfavourable pregnancy outcomes, e.g. miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (FGR) and intrauterine fetal death. Earlier described case series and cohorts have been based on diverse diagnostic criteria of CIUE. To improve our understanding of clinical outcomes associated with CIUE, we report the obstetric and perinatal outcomes in a cohort based on the recently described diagnostic criteria. Methods: CIUE is defined as an infiltrate occupying 5% or more of the intervillous space with approximately 80% of mononuclear cells positive for CD68 in the absence of an infection. Thirty-eight cases were included. Also previous and subsequent pregnancies were described. Results: Pregnancies accompanied by CIUE frequently resulted in FGR (51.6%) and pre-term birth (55.3%). Twenty-nine out of 38 pregnancies (76.3%) with CIUE resulted in a living baby. Women with CIUE frequently have had a miscarriage (16/38; 42%). Four-teen subsequent pregnancies in 8 women resulted in 2 miscarriages, 2 terminations of pregnancy for FGR, 1 early neonatal death and 9 living babies (9/14; 64.3%). Histopathologically confirmed CIUE recurred in 5 out of 10 subsequent pregnancies. Two pregnancies with recurrent CIUE were terminated, one pregnancy ended in a late miscarriage and another resulted in term birth complicated by FGR. Recurrent CIUE can also be accompanied by an uncomplicated pregnancy (1/5; 20%). Conclusion: This study provides additional insight into the clinical phenotype of CIUE and emphasises the need for further research to understand the pathophysiology behind different pregnancy outcomes in CIUE.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands.

507,Nutritional status and its determinants among community-dwelling older adults in Jordan,"Background: The elderly population of Jordan is growing, due to the low mortality rate, high total fertility rate, and the high rate of forced migration from neighboring countries to Jordan in recent years. However, the prevalence of chronic illnesses associated with other comorbidities among the elderly population in Jordan is high. Maintaining a good nutritional status is essential for maintaining general health and well-being among older people. Aim: The aim of this study is to identify the nutritional status of community-dwelling older adults in Jordan and determine its possible associated factors. Methodology: A cross-sectional, descriptive design was utilized. Proportional multistage nonprobability sampling was employed to obtain a convenient sample of 225 Jordanian community-dwelling older adults. The participants were asked to complete a set of questionnaires related to nutritional status, which included a demographic information sheet, and the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Results: Among the sample, only 60 participants (26.7%) showed normal nutritional status. Most of the participants (n = 156; 68.3%) were found to be at risk of malnutrition, and nine participants (4%) were found to suffer from malnutrition. Advanced age (r = -0.631; p = 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.546; p = 0.001), being single (mean (M) = 20.43, SD = 3.55), being male (M = 21.10, SD = 3.73), being unemployed (M = 21.71, SD = 3.51), being dependent in activities of daily living (ADLs) (M = 21.35; SD = 3.62), eating only two meals per day (M = 19.60; SD = 3.39), having suffered from illness or anxiety in the preceding 3 months (M = 21.11; SD = 2.39), having a mid-arm circumference of less than 31 cm (M = 19.51; SD = 3.47), low consumption of fruit and vegetables (M = 20.79; SD = 2.53), and polypharmacy (M = 20.62, SD = 4.09) were found to predict susceptibility to malnutrition among the participating older adults. Amongst the variables, age was identified as the most significant predictor of nutritional status and explained approximately 40% of the variance in nutritional status. Conclusion: Malnutrition in older adults is a multifaceted phenomenon that needs to be integrated into the comprehensive assessment of older adults. It is essential that health-care professionals, particularly nurses, are fully aware of the associated risks of malnutrition among the elderly population. The high prevalence of the risk factors for malnutrition warrants conducting a controlled national-based assessment, using probability sampling, of the nutritional status among older adults in Jordan. Specifically, there is a real need to assess nutritional status among older adults who are at high risk of malnutrition, including senior, unmarried, male, unemployed, ADL dependent, and/or poly-medicated older adults.","Affiliations 1 Adult Health Nursing Department, Faculty of Nursing, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan. 2 Department of Nutritional Epidemiology & Clinical Nutrition, Center for Human Nutrition, School of Medicine and Nursing, University of California at Los Angles (UCLA), Los Angeles, California, USA. 3 Maternal-Child Health Nursing Department, Faculty of Nursing, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan. 4 Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan. 5 Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.","Issa M Hweidi , Catherine L Carpenter , Salwa M Al-Obeisat , Hossam N Alhawatmeh , Mohammad S Nazzal , Mohamad I Jarrah ",Nurs Forum,2021 Jul,"Activities of Daily Living,Aged,Cross-Sectional Studies,Geriatric Assessment,Humans,Independent Living*,Jordan / epidemiology,Male,Nutritional Status*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33834507

Estimates show that pregnancies residing within official ""pacification"" borders had 0.07 standard deviation better birth outcomes than pregnancies on the same street but giving birth shortly before the police's arrival. Pacification effects concentrate in the third trimester of gestation and are followed by increases in the number of prenatal visits. No evidence of spillovers is found in areas immediately circumventing pacification borders.

509,Labour induction in twin pregnancies,"Medically-indicated deliveries are common in twin pregnancies given the increased risk of various obstetric complications in twin compared to singleton pregnancies, mainly hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and foetal growth restriction. Due to the unique characteristics of twin pregnancies, the success rates and safety of labour induction may be different than in singleton pregnancies. However, while there are abundant data regarding induction of labour in singleton pregnancies, the efficacy and safety of labour induction in twin pregnancies have been far less studied. In the current manuscript we summarize available data on various aspects of labour induction in twin pregnancies including incidence, success rate, prognostic factors, safety and methods for labour induction in twins. This information may assist healthcare providers in counselling patients with twin pregnancies when labour induction is indicated.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lis Hospital for Women, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. 2 Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 3 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

510,Actor-Partner Analyses of the Associations Between Harsh Discipline and Parent-Child Relationships in China,"Based on the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM), this study examined the actor and partner effects of parental harsh discipline on the parent-child relationship in a sample of Chinese children. A total of 1,149 Chinese middle-school-aged children who were recruited to participate in this survey completed measures of their fathers' and mothers' psychological aggression (PA) and corporal punishment (CP) toward them and their affinitive and conflicting relationship with the father and mother. Results from the APIM analysis showed that both fathers' and mothers' harsh discipline were negatively associated with parent-child affinity and positively associated with parent-child conflict (βs < .33, ps < .001). Furthermore, results also showed that mothers' CP was negatively related to father-child affinity (βs = -.10, ps < .01) and mothers' CP and PA were positively related to father-child conflict (βs < .13, ps < .01), whereas fathers' harsh discipline was not related to mother-child relationship (βs > .04, ps > .05). Findings indicated that a parent's harsh discipline affected not only their own relationship with children but also their spouse's relationship with children. Findings in the present study highlighted the importance of decreasing both fathers' and mothers' use of harsh discipline when conducting appropriate prevention intervention to improve the parent-child relationship, especially the father-child relationship.","Affiliation 1 Capital Normal University, Beijing, P.R.

511,Herbal medicines to the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections: advantages of the multi-targets action,"The research for new treatments of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) is important due to their high prevalence and number of hospitalizations. The purpose of this review is to address the pathophysiology of SSTIs to highlight the advantages of herbal medicines to their treatment, showing examples of species and compounds with multi-targets action. SSTIs have a complex physiopathology involving the microorganism, as well as inflammation and difficult healing. Therefore, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and healing activities are an approach possible for their treatment. Herbal medicines have a wide diversity of biological compounds, mainly phenolic compounds that may act on different targets and also have synergism between them. Therefore, a single medicine may have the four key activities that allied allow eliminating the infection, control the inflammation process and accelerating the healing process, preventing complications with chronic infections.","Affiliations 1 Programa de Pós graduação em Ciências Farmacêuticas, CIPHARMA, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil. 2 Programa de Pós Graduação em Biotecnologia, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil. 3 Programa de Pós Graduação em Ciências Biológicas, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil.","Tatiane Roquete Amparo , Janaína Brandão Seibert , Paula Melo de Abreu Vieira , Luiz Fernando Medeiros Teixeira , Orlando David Henrique Dos Santos , Gustavo Henrique Bianco de Souza ",Phytother Res,2020 Jan,"Review,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Plants, Medicinal / chemistry*,Skin Diseases / drug therapy*,Soft Tissue Infections / drug therapy*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31713305
512,The Relationship between Adaptation to Pregnancy and Prenatal Attachment in High-Risk Pregnancies,"Background: Although pregnancy is a physiological process, there are various changes which need to be adapted to. Adaptation and prenatal attachment are important for both the mother's and baby's health. These situations are more crucial for women with high-risk pregnancy. The study aimed to determine the relationship between adaptation to pregnancy and prenatal attachment among women with high-risk pregnancy, as well as socio-demographic and obstetric parameters which affected this adaptation. Subjects and methods: This descriptive and analytic study's data were collected from high-risk pregnant women (n=479) who were receiving treatment at two public hospitals in Turkey using Prenatal Self-Evaluation Form (PSEQ) and Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI). Descriptive statistics, correlation and comparative analyses were used in data analyses. Results: It was determined that adaptation to pregnancy was medium and prenatal attachment was high in high-risk pregnant (PSEQ mean score:159.43±27.05; PAI mean score: 63.79±10.75). There was a significant negative relationship between the scales (r=-0.556, p<0.01). This relationship showed that as adaptation to pregnancy increased, prenatal attachment also increased. There was significant difference in the PSEQ by age, educational status, employment status, marital status, year of marriage, spouse's educational and employment status, having health insurance, family type, income status, spouse's attitudes towards pregnancy, number of pregnancies, number of births, having living children, whether the pregnancy was planned, pregnancy week and prenatal attachment. Conclusion: According to results, there is relationship between adaptation to pregnancy and prenatal attachment in high-risk pregnancies and some sociodemographic and obstetric factors affects adaptation to pregnancy. Determining these factors can serve as a guide for preventing and reducing additional problems that may be encountered in pregnancy and postpartum period in high-risk pregnant women.","Affiliation 1 Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.","Fatma Pehlivanoğlu Çelik , Sezer Er Güneri",Psychiatr Danub,2020 Nov,"Adaptation, Psychological*,Adolescent,Adult,Child,Educational Status,Employment / statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Marital Status / statistics & numerical data,Parity,Postpartum Period,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, High-Risk / psychology*,Pregnant Women / psychology*,Turkey,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33212465
513,Competency-based assessment in nutrition education: A systematic literature review,"Background: A suitably prepared and qualified nutrition and dietetics workforce is part of the solution to combating the burden of disease. Competency-based assessment is a key part of the education of future workforces. Although there has been recent attention on competency-based assessment in dietetics, there is little exploration of competency-based education for the preparation of nutritionists. The present study aimed to understand how competency-based assessment is implemented and evaluated in nutrition education. Methods: A systematic literature review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were initially searched in February 2020 using key words related to competenc* in combination with nutrition or dietetic and their synonyms. An updated search was completed again in March 2021. Studies that met eligibility criteria where the focus was on nutrition and involved a method of competency-based assessment were synthesised narratively. Results: From a total of 6262 titles and abstracts, six studies on competency assessment in nutrition education were identified. The assessments focused on the development of key skills, including motivational interviewing and nutrition assessment, changes to knowledge and attitudes on food and culture, and self-perceived development of communication, collaboration, management, advocacy, scholarship and professional capabilities. No studies were found that assessed promotion of health and wellbeing or the food chain competencies. Conclusions: The lack of research in competency-based assessment must be addressed to ensure we are effectively preparing future nutritionists for work such that they can impact health outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Department of Sport, Exercise and Nutrition, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Galway, Ireland. 2 Department of Nutrition, Dietetics and Food, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.","Sarah O'Donovan , Claire Palermo , Lisa Ryan ",J Hum Nutr Diet,2022 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Systematic Review,Counseling,Dietetics*,Health Education,Humans,Nutrition Assessment,Nutritional Status,Nutritionists*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34541713
514,Noninvasive three-state sleep-wake staging in mice using electric field sensors,"Study objective: Validate a novel method for sleep-wake staging in mice using noninvasive electric field (EF) sensors. Methods: Mice were implanted with electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) electrodes and housed individually. Noninvasive EF sensors were attached to the exterior of each chamber to record respiration and other movement simultaneously with EEG, EMG, and video. A sleep-wake scoring method based on EF sensor data was developed with reference to EEG/EMG and then validated by three expert scorers. Additionally, novice scorers without sleep-wake scoring experience were self-trained to score sleep using only the EF sensor data, and results were compared to those from expert scorers. Lastly, ability to capture three-state sleep-wake staging with EF sensors attached to traditional mouse home-cages was tested. Results: EF sensors quantified wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep with high agreement (>93%) and comparable inter- and intra-scorer error as EEG/EMG. Novice scorers successfully learned sleep-wake scoring using only EF sensor data and scoring criteria, and achieved high agreement with expert scorers (>91%). When applied to traditional home-cages, EF sensors enabled classification of three-state (wake, NREM and REM) sleep-wake independent of EEG/EMG. Conclusions: EF sensors score three-state sleep-wake architecture with high agreement to conventional EEG/EMG sleep-wake scoring 1) without invasive surgery, 2) from outside the home-cage, and 3) and without requiring specialized training or equipment. EF sensors provide an alternative method to assess rodent sleep for animal models and research laboratories in which EEG/EMG is not possible or where noninvasive approaches are preferred.","Affiliations 1 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.

516,Study of effects of mifepristone on full-term pregnancies,"The induction of labour is required for various indications in obstetrics. Various regimens and drugs are advocated for use in labour induction. Mifepristone is one such drug which has a definite role in first and second-trimester pregnancy terminations. However, its role in the third-trimester is still being reviewed. In the present study, the effect of mifepristone on cervical ripening was assessed and results interpreted.Impact statementWhat is already known on the subject? The role of mifepristone in termination of pregnancies at term is controversial. Some studies report onset of labour after giving mifepristone whereas others do not report any significant role.What do the results of the study add? Mifepristone has a role in improving Bishop score and can be used as a pre-induction cervical ripening agent before using other methods for labour induction. It does not report any adverse effects on the mother or foetus.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Mifepristone needs to be studied more in term pregnancies as induction of labour is increasingly required in today's scenario for various reasons. However, its role in improving the Bishop score as found in this study helps in decreasing dose of other labour inducing agents.","Affiliation 1 Department of obstetrics and gynecology, Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, India.","Priyanka Sharma , Kushla Pathania , Uday Bhanu Rana ",J Obstet Gynaecol,2020 Feb,"Evaluation Study,Adult,Cervical Ripening / drug effects*,Female,Hormone Antagonists / administration & dosage*,Humans,Labor, Induced / methods*,Mifepristone / administration & dosage*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Trimester, Third / drug effects,Prospective Studies,Term Birth / drug effects*,Treatment Outcome,Hormone Antagonists,Mifepristone",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31335266
517,"Transdiagnostic Associations Among Parental Causal Locus Attributions, Child Behavior and Psychosocial Treatment Outcomes: A Systematic Review","Parents' interpretations of the cause of their children's behavior, i.e., parental attributions, are linked to parenting behavior and child development. However, it is not yet known whether parental attributions are systematically associated with children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms and behavior or psychosocial treatment engagement and outcomes across diagnostic categories. This systematic review aimed to fill this knowledge gap using a transdiagnostic perspective to synthesize the literature on the associations between parent-causal and child-responsible attributions and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior, treatment engagement, and treatment outcomes for parents and children. A total of 67 studies were identified. Overall, biased child-responsible attributions were associated with elevated child internalizing and externalizing symptoms and behavior across diagnoses, while findings on the association between parent-causal attributions and child behavior were inconsistent. The link between parental attributions and treatment engagement was also mixed, varying across treatment type, child diagnosis, and focus of attributions. Regarding treatment outcomes, less biased parent-causal and child-responsible attributions were linked to post-treatment improvements in children's behaviors, while mixed findings were reported on post-treatment improvements in parental attributions. Findings are discussed with a focus on approaches to enhance the effectiveness of assessment and psychosocial treatment approaches across diagnostic categories with consideration of parental attributions.","Affiliations 1 McCain Centre for Child Youth and Family Mental Health, Child Youth and Emerging Adult Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada. 2 Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. 3 Department of Applied Psychology and Human Development, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. 4 Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Library, Toronto, ON, Canada. 5 Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact (Formerly Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics), McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. 6 McCain Centre for Child Youth and Family Mental Health, Child Youth and Emerging Adult Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada. brendan.andrade@camh.ca. 7 Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. brendan.andrade@camh.ca.","Hali Kil , Madison Aitken , Shanelle Henry , Ortenc Hoxha , Terri Rodak , Kathryn Bennett , Brendan F Andrade ",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,2021 Jun,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Systematic Review,Child,Child Behavior,Child Development,Humans,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33598852
518,Parental Expectations Are Associated with Children's Sleep Duration and Sleep Hygiene Habits,"Objective: Although parents recognize the importance of sleep, most have a limited understanding of children's sleep needs. This study examined whether parental expectations about sleep were linked to children and adolescent's sleep duration and sleep hygiene. Method: Participants included 376 unique parent-child dyads. Parents (mean age = 47.0 years, SD = 6.7) estimated the number of hours of sleep their children (mean age = 13.0 years, SD = 2.2; 9-17 years) needed. These estimates were age-matched with recommended pediatric guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the National Sleep Foundation to yield 3 groups: expect less (8%-11%), expect appropriate (85%-89%), and expect more (3%-4%). Sleep duration for school nights and weekends were reported by children and parents. Sleep hygiene included sleep-promoting practices (quiet, dark bedroom, regular bed/wake times, consistent routine) and sleep-interfering practices (physiological arousal, presleep worry, alcohol/smoking intake, daytime napping, screen time). Results: Most parents (68.7%) endorsed that children do not get enough sleep. Linear and logistic regressions were used to assess the impact of parental expectations. For every additional hour of sleep expected, children slept between 15.5 (parent-report 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0-22.0) and 17.9 minutes (child-report 95% CI, 9.7-26.2) longer on school nights, adjusted for age, sex, puberty, and parental education. For parents who expected less sleep than recommended, their children had the shortest sleep duration, least favorable sleeping environments, and greater presleep worry. Conclusion: Parental sleep expectations were directly linked to children's sleep duration. Pediatricians and primary care providers can mobilize knowledge to optimally convey accurate information about developmental sleep needs and recommended hours to parents to promote longer sleep.","Affiliation 1 Pediatric Public Health Psychology Laboratory, Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montréal, QC, Canada.","Denise C Jarrin , Yara Abu Awad, Hillary Rowe, Neressa A O Noel, Joanne Ramil, Jennifer J McGrath",J Dev Behav Pediatr,2020 Sep,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Child,Habits,Humans,Middle Aged,Motivation*,Parents,Sleep,Sleep Hygiene*,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32433218

Poor sleep is cited as a factor predisposing to URTIs, but the evidence is unclear. Objective: To systematically review whether sleep duration and quality influence the frequency and duration of URTIs. Methods: Three databases and bibliographies of included papers were searched for studies assessing associations between sleep duration or quality and URTIs. We performed dual title and abstract selection, discussed full-text exclusion decisions and completed 50% of data extraction in duplicate. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale assessed study quality and we estimated odds ratios (ORs) using random effects meta-analysis. Results: Searches identified 5146 papers. Eleven met inclusion criteria, with nine included in meta-analyses: four good, two fair and five poor for risk of bias. Compared to study defined 'normal' sleep duration, shorter sleep was associated with increased URTIs (OR: 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.42, I2: 11%, P < 0.001) and longer sleep was not significantly associated (OR: 1.11 95% CI: 0.99-1.23, I2: 0%, P = 0.070). Sensitivity analyses using a 7- to 9-hour baseline found that sleeping shorter than 7-9 hours was associated with increased URTIs (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.22-1.41, I2: 0%, P < 0.001). Sleeping longer than 7-9 hours was non-significantly associated with increased URTIs (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.00-1.33, I2: 0%, P = 0.050, respectively). We were unable to pool sleep quality studies. No studies reported on sleep duration and URTI severity or duration. Conclusions: Reduced sleep, particularly shorter than 7-9 hours, is associated with increased URTIs. Strategies improving sleep should be explored to prevent URTIs.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medical Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 2 Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 3 Bodleian Health Care Libraries, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.","Charlotte H Robinson , Charlotte Albury , David McCartney , Benjamin Fletcher , Nia Roberts , Imogen Jury , Joseph Lee ",Fam Pract,2021 Nov 24,"Meta-Analysis,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Systematic Review,Anti-Bacterial Agents / therapeutic use,Humans,Inappropriate Prescribing,Respiratory Tract Infections* / drug therapy,Respiratory Tract Infections* / epidemiology,Sleep,Sleep Quality*,Anti-Bacterial Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33997896
520,"[Franciscus Sylvius: A Life for Clinic, Research, Teaching And a Little Gin]","Franciscus Sylvius, latinized from Franz de le Boë (*15 March 1614 in Hanau; † 14 November 1672 in Leiden), was a Hessian-Dutch physician, anatomist, and natural scientist of Flemish descent. He was an important clinician and iatrochemist, and is considered the founder of scientifically oriented medicine and clinical chemistry. Sylvius introduced the concept of affinity and dealt with digestive processes and body fluids. He was one of the leading exponents of the concept of blood circulation developed by William Harvey. As the person responsible for practical medicine in Leiden, Sylvius established bedside teaching as part of the medical curriculum, and he introduced his students to clinical medicine in an experimental way, both contrary to the rules of the time. He was also interested in pharmacology, herbalism and botany. For heartburn and digestive disorders, Sylvius mixed juniper berries, herbs and alcohol to create a medicine. According to legend, Sylvius marketed this medicine as Genever, for which the name Gin was later adopted in the British Isles, but not only used for medical purposes. Accordingly, the city of birth of Sylvius today calls itself a ""birthplace of gin"".",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Ulrich Koehler, Niklas Koehler, Andreas Weissflog",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,2020 Dec,"Historical Article,Review,Alcoholic Beverages / history*,Clinical Medicine / history*,Germany,Herbal Medicine / history*,History, 17th Century,Humans,Male,Netherlands,Pharmacology, Clinical / history*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33327010
521,Platelet Counts in Uncomplicated Pregnancies at Term,"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate platelet counts at delivery in uncomplicated pregnancies between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation. Study design: Platelet counts in women 16 to 45 years of age from August 1, 2011, through May 15, 2018, with a singleton pregnancy that delivered from 370/7 to 416/7 weeks of gestation. Women with pregnancy-related complications, preexisting disorders, or on medications that could affect platelet counts were excluded. Results: A total of 18,526 women had uncomplicated pregnancies with mean platelet count from 370/7 to 416/7 weeks of gestation of 220 × 109/L. The lower limit 95th percentile (2.5% quantile) was 120 × 109/L. Platelet counts decreased weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation, becoming significant at 39 weeks of gestation and beyond, compared with 37 weeks (p < 0.01). Mean platelet counts: 225 × 109/L at 37 weeks, 223 × 109/L at 38 weeks, 219 × 109/L at 39 weeks, 218 × 109/L at 40 weeks, and 216 × 109/L at 41 weeks of gestation. Platelet counts of less than 150 × 109/L occurred in 9.7%. Conclusion: Platelet counts in uncomplicated pregnancies decrease weekly from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation. This will be important to consider when serial platelet values are monitored for other indications.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.","Gregorio Riera , Megan Galindo , Mark Turrentine ",Am J Perinatol,2020 May,"Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Ethnicity,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Platelet Count*,Pregnancy / blood,Pregnancy Trimester, Third / blood*,Racial Groups,Reference Values,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30978745
522,"Teachers' perspectives on nutrition education in boys' public high schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Background: Nutrition education in school may positively affect students' eating behaviour. Teachers need to be empowered to teach nutrition, but no studies have investigated teachers' views on this topic in Saudi Arabia. Aims: This study investigated the perspective of teachers on nutrition education and their confidence in teaching it in boys' public high schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods: In 2015, 80 boys' public high schools were randomly selected from four areas of Riyadh, and 80 teachers (biological sciences, physical education and health education teachers) were interviewed using a validated questionnaire. A Fisher exact test was run to test the relationship between teachers' perspective and confidence level, and their subject taught. Results: Almost all the teachers (98%) agreed that the health education curriculum should be taught as a core subject for high-school students. Most of the teachers (89%) were interested in teaching nutrition. However, 64% indicated that they did not have adequate nutrition curricular materials and 70% considered that they had not received adequate training on nutrition education. However, 89% were confident that their students would be interested in nutrition and that such education would change their dietary behaviour. Science and health education teachers were more interested in teaching nutrition and were more confident in their ability to do so than physical education teachers (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Most of the teachers were interested in teaching nutrition but barriers existed, such as lack of training and teaching materials, which affected teachers' confidence in delivering nutrition education in their curricula.","Affiliation 1 Department of Community Health Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Khalid Aldubayan ,East Mediterr Health J,2020 Feb 24,"Adolescent,Curriculum*,Health Education / methods*,Humans,Male,Nutritional Sciences / education*,Saudi Arabia,School Teachers / psychology*,Schools,Students,Surveys and Questionnaires,Teacher Training / organization & administration",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141594
523,Prospective association of parental and child internalizing symptoms: Mediation of parenting practices and irritability,"Maternal internalizing symptoms have been linked with child internalizing symptoms, but paternal internalizing difficulties have received little attention. Our aims were to prospectively analyse the simultaneous effect of maternal and paternal internalizing symptoms on child internalizing difficulties, examining gender differences, and to verify the mediating effect of parenting practices and child irritability. The sample included 470 families assessed at child ages 3, 6, 8, and 11. Multi-group structural equation modelling was performed with Mplus8.2. Complete equivalence was found between boys and girls for all paths. Maternal internalizing symptoms at age 3 had an indirect effect on child internalizing symptoms at age 11, via irritability at age 8. Paternal internalizing symptoms at age 3 were not associated with any of the variables under study. Maternal internalizing symptoms and child irritability are targets for intervention in order to prevent child internalizing difficulties.","Affiliations 1 Unitat d'Epidemiologia i de Diagnòstic en Psicopatologia del Desenvolupament (2017 SGR33), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. 2 Instituto de Psiquiatría y Salud Mental Marañón, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain. 3 Departament de Psicobiologia i Metodologia de les Ciències de la Salut, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. 4 Departament de Psicologia Clínica i de la Salut, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.","Fátima Valencia , Eva Penelo , Núria de la Osa , J Blas Navarro , Lourdes Ezpeleta ",Br J Dev Psychol,2021 Sep,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Child Rearing,Child, Preschool,Fathers,Female,Humans,Male,Parenting*,Parents*,Sex Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33528068
524,Herbal Medicine Treatment for Influenza: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"The aim of this research is to evaluate the clinical evidence of an herbal medicine (HM) treatment on influenza and describe the potential benefits and adverse events by reviewing all relevant randomized controlled trials. All papers published from 2010 to 2019 in all languages in six databases were searched, including all randomized controlled trials on adults and children, testing herbal medicine for treatment of influenza, alone or in combination with conventional antiviral therapy. The main outcome parameters of interest were total effective rate, time to resolution of fever, adverse events, complications, and duration of viral shedding. 25 trials of 3044 patients were included. Herbal medicine compared to placebo significantly reduced time to fever resolution by 4.96[Formula: see text]h (mean difference, [Formula: see text]4.96; 95% CI, [Formula: see text]7.11 to [Formula: see text]2.80; [Formula: see text]), herbal medicine compared to oseltamivir showed no significant difference (mean difference, [Formula: see text]1.82; 95% CI, [Formula: see text]6.08 to 2.44; [Formula: see text]), and herbal medicine plus oseltamivir combined treatment significantly reduced duration of fever by 7.84[Formula: see text]h compared to a single treatment with oseltamivir (mean difference, [Formula: see text]7.84; 95% CI, [Formula: see text]12.51 to [Formula: see text]3.17; [Formula: see text]).

HM presented fewer adverse events compared to oseltamivir, but the difference was not significant (risk difference, [Formula: see text]0.04; 95% CI, [Formula: see text]0.09 to 0.00; [Formula: see text]), and the combined treatment did not increase adverse events compared to oseltamivir (risk difference, [Formula: see text]0.02; 95% CI, [Formula: see text]0.06 to 0.02; [Formula: see text]). Research findings show that herbal medicine treatments have beneficial therapeutic effects on influenza and could decrease duration of fever and improve total effective rate.

525,First trimester naproxen exposure and outcome of pregnancy - A German case series,"In contrast to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), naproxen use during pregnancy is not well studied. The objective of this analysis was to assess negative effects on pregnancy outcomes following naproxen exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy. Out of 121 exposed pregnancies prospectively recorded by two German teratology information services (TIS) 15 ended as spontaneous abortion and ten were electively terminated; in one case for prenatal diagnosis of anencephaly. Four pregnancies were stillborn, in these cases naproxen was discontinued more than two months before the event. Of 95 live-born infants, including three pairs of twins, two were born with major birth defects: one with dysmelia of the left hand and foot and another with a complex congenital heart defect, esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, and choanal stenosis. The results of this case series do not suggest that naproxen has a significant teratogenic effect. However, due to the limited cohort size and lack of comparable reference group results should be interpreted with caution and better studied NSAIDs such as ibuprofen should be preferred in the first and second trimester of pregnancy.

526,Assessment of effects of total sleep deprivation and subsequent recovery sleep: a methodological strategy feasible without sleep laboratory,"Background: Sleep is critical for maintaining homeostasis in bodily and neurobehavioral functions. This homeostasis can be disturbed by sleep interruption and restored to normal by subsequent recovery sleep. Most research regarding recovery sleep (RS) effects has been conducted in specialized sleep laboratories, whereas small, less-well equipped research units may lack the possibilities to run studies in this area. Hence, the aims of the present study were to develop and validate an experimental protocol, which allows a thorough assessment of at-home recovery sleep after sleep deprivation. Methods: The experimental protocol, comprising one night of baseline sleep (BL) at home, one night of monitored total sleep deprivation and a subsequent recovery night at home, was tested in a sample of 30 healthy participants. Subjects' fatigue and alertness were assessed prior to and after each night. Sleep at home (BL, RS) was objectively assessed using portable polysomnography. To check whether our at-home sleep assessments yielded results that are comparable to those conducted in sleep laboratories, we compared the sleep data assessed in our study with sleep data assessed in laboratory studies. Results: Sleep parameters assessed during RS exhibited changes as expected (prolonged total sleep time, better sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep rebound). Sleep parameters of BL and RS were in line with parameters assessed in previous studies examining sleep in a laboratory setting. Fatigue normalized after one night of RS; alertness partly recovered. Conclusions: Our results suggest a successful implementation of our new experimental protocol, emphasizing it as a useful tool for future studies on RS outside of well-equipped sleep laboratories.","Affiliations 1 Department of Physiological Psychology, University of Bamberg, Markusplatz 3, Bamberg, Germany. cindy.stroemel@uni-bamberg.de. 2 Department of Physiological Psychology, University of Bamberg, Markusplatz 3, Bamberg, Germany.","Cindy Stroemel-Scheder , Stefan Lautenbacher ",BMC Psychol,2021 Sep 15,"Humans,Laboratories*,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Deprivation*,Wakefulness",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34526155
527,Does memory reactivation during sleep support generalization at the cost of memory specifics?,"Sleep is important for memory, but does it favor consolidation of specific details or extraction of generalized information? Both may occur together when memories are reactivated during sleep, or a loss of certain memory details may facilitate generalization. To examine these issues, we tested memory in participants who viewed landscape paintings by six artists. Paintings were cropped to show only a section of the scene. During a learning phase, each painting section was presented with the artist's name and with a nonverbal sound that had been uniquely associated with that artist. In a test of memory for specifics, participants were shown arrays of six painting sections, all by the same artist. Participants attempted to select the one that was seen in the learning phase. Generalization was tested by asking participants to view new paintings and, for each one, decide which of the six artists created it. After this testing, participants had a 90-minute sleep opportunity with polysomnographic monitoring. When slow-wave sleep was detected, three of the sound cues associated with the artists were repeatedly presented without waking the participants. After sleep, participants were again tested for memory specifics and generalization. Memory reactivation during sleep due to the sound cues led to a relative decline in accuracy on the specifics test, which could indicate the transition to a loss of detail that facilitates generalization, particularly details such as the borders. Generalization performance showed very little change after sleep and was unaffected by the sound cues. Although results tentatively implicate sleep in memory transformation, further research is needed to examine memory change across longer time periods.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States.

529,Science-based policy: targeted nutrition for all ages and the role of bioactives,"Globally, there has been a marked increase in longevity, but it is also apparent that significant inequalities remain, especially the inequality related to insufficient 'health' to enjoy or at least survive those later years. The major causes include lack of access to proper nutrition and healthcare services, and often the basic information to make the personal decisions related to diet and healthcare options and opportunities. Proper nutrition can be the best predictor of a long healthy life expectancy and, conversely, when inadequate and/or improper a prognosticator of a sharply curtailed expectancy. There is a dichotomy in both developed and developing countries as their populations are experiencing the phenomenon of being 'over fed and under nourished', i.e., caloric/energy excess and lack of essential nutrients, leading to health deficiencies, skyrocketing global obesity rates, excess chronic diseases, and premature mortality. There is need for new and/or innovative approaches to promoting health as individuals' age, and for public health programs to be a proactive blessing and not an archaic status quo 'eat your vegetables' mandate. A framework for progress has been proposed and published by the World Health Organization in their Global Strategy and Action Plan on Ageing and Health (WHO (2017) Advancing the right to health: the vital role of law. https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/252815/9789241511384-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y .

Couple this WHO mandate with current academic research into the processes of ageing, and the ingredients or regimens that have shown benefit and/or promise of such benefits.

530,Prevalence and Determinants of Unintended Pregnancy in Sub -Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review,"Over forty percent of pregnancies worldwide are unintended, with a quarter of these from Africa. There is a growing body of evidence regarding the adverse health, economic, societal, and developmental consequences of unintended pregnancies. The main aim of this systematic review is to report on the current prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa. A literature search (in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Scopus) was performed up to 29 May 2019. The Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual guidelines to assess the quality of peer-reviewed quantitative articles were used to select articles that met our inclusion criteria. A total of 29 articles from 9 countries were included in the final review. The mean unintended pregnancy rate was 33.9%. The mean unwanted pregnancy rate was 11.2%, while the mean mistimed pregnancy rate was 22.1%. Mistimed pregnancies were more frequent across the 13 studies that classified unintended pregnancies into the unwanted and mistimed pregnancy sub-groups. Being an adolescent (19 years old or less), single, and having 5 children or more were consistent risk factors for unintended pregnancy. Awareness and use of modern contraception, level of education, socio-economic status, religion, and area of residence as independent variables were either protective or associated with an increased risk of reporting a pregnancy as being unintended. The unintended pregnancy rate in sub-Saharan Africa remains high, especially among singles, adolescents, and women with 5 or more children. There was no uniform tool used across studies to capture pregnancy intention. The studies did not capture pregnancy intention among women whose pregnancies ended up as stillbirths or abortions. More research is required to ascertain when it is best to capture pregnancy intention, and how exclusion or inclusion of pregnancies ending up as stillbirths or abortions impact reported unintended pregnancy rates.","Affiliations 1 Athena Institute for Research on Innovation and Communication in Health and Life Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 2 University of Bordeaux, Inserm, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, Team IDLIC, France.","Luchuo Engelbert Bain , Marjolein B M Zweekhorst , Tjard de Cock Buning ",Afr J Reprod Health,2020 Jun,"Review,Systematic Review,Adolescent,Adult,Africa South of the Sahara,Contraception Behavior,Educational Status,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned*,Pregnancy, Unwanted*,Prevalence,Residence Characteristics,Social Class,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34077104

Enteral feeding tubes can also be used to administer medicines. Patients who may require enteral feeding include those who are unconscious, or those with neurological swallowing disorders, upper GI obstruction, GI dysfunction or malabsorption. There are several routes that can be used for enteral feeding including gastrostomy, post-pyloric, nasogastric, continuous pump and bolus feeding. When undertaking enteral feeding, nurses and other healthcare professionals should be aware of the potential complications such as tube blockage and infection.

532,Processing methods and mechanisms for alkaloid-rich Chinese herbal medicines: A review,"The processing of Chinese herbal medicine is a form of pharmaceutical technology developed over thousands of years, in order to increase efficiency and decrease toxicity of herbs in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Herbal processing is essential for safe and effective application of TCM in clinical practice, as it alters the active chemical components and therefore the functions of herbal medicines. Alkaloid-rich herbal medicines in TCM are commonly processed by cleansing, cutting, processing by dry stir-frying, stir-frying with liquid adjuvants, and processing by water decoction. In addition, commonly used adjuvants for processing alkaloid-rich herbal medicines are river sand, wine, vinegar, brine, honey and herbal juice. For alkaloid-rich herbal medicines, the main chemical reactions that occur during processing include hydrolysis, oxidation, replacement, decomposition and condensation. This paper aimed to summarize the processing methods and mechanisms for alkaloid-rich Chinese herbal medicines, and provide much-needed theoretical support and scientific evidence for understanding those mechanisms and effects. Information on processing methods for alkaloid-rich herbal medicines was collected from classic books of herbal medicine, PhD and MSc dissertations, online scientific databases including PubMed, SciFinder, Scopus, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar and Google Scholar. This paper should help to advance our knowledge of the processing mechanisms and aid in the development of processing methods for alkaloid-rich Chinese herbal medicines.","Affiliations 1 School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, Sichuan Province, China. 2 School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, Sichuan Province, China.

533,Outcomes Associated With Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in Twin Compared With Singleton Gestations,"Objective: To evaluate whether pregnancy outcomes associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in twin pregnancies differ relatively from those in singleton pregnancy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of all women with a liveborn singleton or twin hospital birth in Ontario, Canada, between 2012 and 2019. Data were obtained from the Better Outcomes Registry & Network Ontario. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between women with and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in twin gestations, and separately in singleton gestations. Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) and 95% CIs were generated using modified Poisson regression and were compared between twins and singletons using relative risk ratios. Results: Overall, 932,218 women met the study criteria, of whom 917,542 (98.4%) and 14,676 (1.6%) had singleton and twin gestations, respectively. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was higher in women with twin compared with singleton gestations (14.4% vs 6.4%, aRR 1.85 [1.76-1.94]). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were associated with certain adverse outcomes in singleton gestations only and with other adverse outcomes in both the singleton and twin gestations, but the aRR was lower in twins. For example, preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation (singletons: 15.2% [hypertensive disorders of pregnancy] vs 5.4% [no hypertensive disorders of pregnancy], aRR 2.42; twins: 67.5% [hypertensive disorders of pregnancy] vs 50.4% [no hypertensive disorders of pregnancy], aRR 1.30) and neonatal respiratory morbidity (singletons: 16.3% [hypertensive disorders of pregnancy] vs 8.7% [no hypertensive disorders of pregnancy], aRR 1.50; twins: 39.8% [hypertensive disorders of pregnancy] vs 32.7% [no hypertensive disorders of pregnancy], aRR 1.13). These findings persisted in the subgroups of women with preeclampsia and early-onset preeclampsia. Conclusions: Although the absolute risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes is higher in twin compared with singleton pregnancies, the incremental risk of adverse outcomes associated with hypertensive disorders in twin pregnancies is lower than the incremental risk in singleton pregnancies. These findings may be attributed in part to the higher baseline risk of preterm birth and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in twin compared with singleton pregnancies.","Affiliation 1 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, and the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, The Better Outcomes Registry & Networks (BORN) Ontario, Ottawa, and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Midwifery Education Program, and the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Radiology and Health Research Methodology and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada; and the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.","Amir Aviram , Howard Berger, Kasim E Abdulaziz, Jon F R Barrett, Beth Murray-Davis, Sarah D McDonald, Michael Geary, Nir Melamed, for DOH-NET (Diabetes, Obesity and Hypertension in Pregnancy Research Network) and SOON (Southern Ontario Obstetrical Network) Investigators",Obstet Gynecol,2021 Sep 1,"Comparative Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cohort Studies,Ethnicity,Female,Humans,Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced / epidemiology*,Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced / ethnology,Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced / etiology,Ontario / epidemiology,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, Twin*,Prenatal Care,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34352849
534,How effective was England's teenage pregnancy strategy? A comparative analysis of high-income countries,"Teenage pregnancy is associated with numerous health risks, both to mothers and infants, and may contribute to entrenched social inequalities. In countries with high rates of teenage pregnancy there is disagreement on effective action to reduce rates. England's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, which cost £280 million over its ten year implementation period, has been highlighted as an effective way of reducing pregnancies after rates fell by more than 50% from 1998 to 2014 and widely advocated as a replicable model for other countries. However, it is not clear whether the fall is attributable to the strategy or to background trends and other events. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy on pregnancy and birth rates using comparators. We compared under-18 pregnancy rates in England with Scotland and Wales using interrupted time series methods. We compared under-18 birth rates and under-20 pregnancy rates in England with European and English-speaking high-income countries using synthetic control methods. In the controlled interrupted time series analyses, trends in rates of teenage pregnancy in England closely followed those in Scotland (0.08 fewer pregnancies per 1000 women per year in England; -0.74 to 0.59) and Wales (0.14 more pregnancies per 1000 women per year in England; -0.48 to 0.76). In synthetic control analyses, under-18 birth rates were very similar in England and the synthetic control. Under-20 pregnancy rates were marginally higher in England than control. Although teenage pregnancies and births in England fell following implementation of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, comparisons with other countries suggest the strategy had little, if any, effect on pregnancy rates. This raises doubts about whether the strategy should be used as a model for future public health interventions in countries aiming to reduce teenage pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 MRC/CSO Social & Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow, UK.

535,Parenting stress and its correlates in an infant mental health unit: a cross-sectional study,"Background: An infant's development is closely linked to the relationship they have with their parents. Parenting stress, affective disorder, and an upbringing with substance-abusing parents can affect parenting quality and increase the risk of children developing behavioral, mental and social problems. The overall aim of the study was to investigate how parents of children attending an outpatient Infant Mental Health (IMH) unit rate their own psychological health and parenting stress, and to explore predictors of parenting stress.Methods: The sample comprised 197 parents, 129 mothers and 68 fathers, referred with their infant/toddler to an outpatient IMH unit for interplay treatment. On admission, the parents completed self-report questionnaires concerning their own mental health problems and parenting stress.Results: The mothers reported significantly more psychiatric symptoms and parenting stress than the fathers. Fathers with substance-abusing parents had often experienced divorce in the family of origin, had a low level of education, and had often experienced trauma. Depression was a predictor for parenting stress for both mothers and fathers.Conclusion: The parents' situation was strained, presenting a variety of psychiatric symptoms and high levels of parenting stress, making assessment of parental health before starting treatment important. The mothers' situations were more serious compared with the fathers', and for both parents depression was a significant predictor for parenting stress. To increase the chances of a positive treatment outcome for the child, both parents should be included in the treatment.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. 2 Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Infant and Toddler Unit, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden. 3 Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. 4 Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Pediatrics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. 5 Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. 6 Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Regional Inpatient Care, Emergency Unit, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.","Eva Tedgård , Ulf Tedgård , Maria Råstam , Björn Axel Johansson ",Nord J Psychiatry,2020 Jan,"Adolescent,Adult,Child Development / physiology,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Mental Health*,Middle Aged,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Stress, Psychological / psychology*,Surveys and Questionnaires,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31553257
536,Roles of motor and cortical activity in sleep rebound in rat,"Sleep pressure that builds up gradually during the extended wakefulness results in sleep rebound. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that wake per se may not be sufficient to drive sleep rebound and that rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep rebound may be differentially regulated. In this study, we investigated the relative contribution of brain versus physical activities in REM and NREM sleep rebound by four sets of experiments. First, we forced locomotion in rats in a rotating wheel for 4 hr and examined subsequent sleep rebound. Second, we exposed the rats lacking homeostatic sleep response after prolonged quiet wakefulness and arousal brain activity induced by chemoactivation of parabrachial nucleus to the same rotating wheel paradigm and tested if physical activity could rescue the sleep homeostasis. Third, we varied motor activity levels while concurrently inhibiting the cortical activity by administering ketamine or xylazine (motor inhibitor), or ketamine + xylazine mixture and investigated if motor activity in the absence of activated cortex can cause NREM sleep rebound. Fourth and finally, we manipulated cortical activity by administering ketamine (that induced active wakefulness and waking brain) alone or in combination with atropine (that selectively inhibits the cortex) and studied if cortical inhibition irrespective of motor activity levels can block REM sleep rebound. Our results demonstrate that motor activity but not cortical activity determines NREM sleep rebound whereas cortical activity but not motor activity determines REM sleep rebound.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 2 Ningxia Key Laboratory of Craniocerebral Diseases, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China. 3 Department of Neurology, Department of Neurology and Neuroscience Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.","Yujun Wen , Yudan Lv , Jianguo Niu , Christopher Xin , Li Cui , Ramalingam Vetrivelan , Jun Lu ",Eur J Neurosci,2020 Nov,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Animals,Electroencephalography*,Homeostasis,Rats,Sleep*,Sleep, REM,Wakefulness",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32588491

538,The potential of salivary biomarkers of nutritional status and dietary intake: A Systematic Review,"Objectives: To explore whether nutritional salivary biomarkers could be used to aid nutritional status assessment and/or support traditional dietary assessment methods for patients. Data and sources: Searches were performed using four electronic databases; MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science. Trial registers (i.e. Cochrane), grey literature and reference lists were searched. Study selection: Studies which measured nutritional salivary biomarkers related to nutritional status and/or dietary intake outcome were included. No restrictions on participants' age, study design, publication date, setting or health status. Animal studies, non-English language studies, commentaries, and conference abstracts were excluded. Results: Study titles and abstracts were screened (n = 7982), full-texts assessed (n = 176) and 85 studies were included in a narrative synthesis. The most promising salivary biomarkers for nutritional status included: glucose, where saliva and serum levels were positively correlated in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), higher salivary calcium levels in post-menopausal women in general and specifically those with lower bone mineral density (BMD), and salivary vitamin D to assess vitamin D status in healthy volunteers. Higher salivary total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitrate/nitrite and fluoride were observed with increased antioxidant, nitrate/nitrite and fluoride dietary intake, respectively. A meta-analysis found significantly higher mean salivary glucose (n = 12) in T2D compared with healthy controls, but there was substantial heterogeneity (I2=94%) and evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: The most promising salivary biomarkers identified in this systematic review were, glucose, vitamin D, calcium, TAC, nitrate/nitrite and fluoride. However, this was based on a small number of studies of varying quality, with many lacking a salivary assay performance assessment. Clinical significance: At present, nutritional salivary biomarkers cannot be used alone to assess nutritional status or dietary intake. Further research into the most promising nutritional salivary biomarkers is required.","Affiliations 1 Centre for Public Health, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, BT12 6BA.

540,Firm parenting and youth adjustment: Stress reactivity and dyadic synchrony of respiratory sinus arrhythmia,"Parental behaviors are potent risk and protective factors for youth development of externalizing problems. Firm control is a parenting strategy that is inconsistently linked to youth adjustment, possibly due to variations in individual biological contexts. Growing research shows that dyadic coregulation of the autonomic nervous system (e.g., parent-child physiological synchrony) is a neurobiological mechanism that links parenting to youth adjustment. However, physiological synchrony may be context-dependent (e.g., adaptive in positive interactions, maladaptive in negative interactions). We aimed to test the role of dyadic synchrony in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during parent-child conflict as a mediator between parent firm control and youth's externalizing problems. To capture youth's stress reactivity, we also tested how galvanic skin response reactivity (GSR-R) moderated this indirect path. The sample included 101 dyads of low socioeconomic-status at-risk preadolescents and parents. Results indicated that youth higher levels of GSR-R significantly intensified the link between parent firm control and dyadic RSA synchrony during conflict. Dyadic RSA synchrony further predicted youth increased in externalizing problems. Overall, results suggest that when parents employ firm control parenting with highly reactive teens, dyadic RSA synchrony elevates, potentially modeling less optimal coping with conflict for the youth, which is associated with increased externalizing problems.","Affiliations 1 Department of Human Development and Family Science, the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. 2 Youth Development Institute, the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. 3 Neuroscience Program, the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.","Assaf Oshri , Sihong Liu , Landry G Huffman , Kalsea J Koss ",Dev Psychobiol,2021 Apr,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Autonomic Nervous System,Humans,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting,Parents,Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32677062
541,"ParentWorks: Evaluation of an Online, Father-Inclusive, Universal Parenting Intervention to Reduce Child Conduct Problems","Evidence-based parenting interventions are effective in reducing conduct problems, yet these interventions have limited reach, and few involve the participation of fathers. This paper describes the outcomes of an open trial of ParentWorks, a universal, online, father-inclusive parenting intervention aiming to decrease childhood behavioural problems and promote positive parenting in mothers and fathers. A total of 388 families (456 individual parents; 36.6% fathers) were included in the study. Mixed model analyses showed significant decreases in child emotional/behavioural problems, dysfunctional parenting, interparental conflict, and parental mental health problems. The baseline severity of child behavioural problems significantly moderated the effects on child outcomes so that children with higher levels of problems benefitted more from the program. Participation of both caregivers in two-parent families, as well as parent sex, did not significantly affect the program outcomes. Results provide initial empirical support for the universal, self-directed, online parenting intervention, in addressing both child behavioural problems and parenting outcomes.

542,Can sleeping position be correctly identified by OSAS studies?,"Objective: Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (POSAS) is a sub-type of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) in which obstructive apnoeas occur mainly in the supine sleeping position. In clinical practice, information on sleep posture is generally gathered by polysomnographic exam (PSG). The current trend in positional therapies consists of position trainers which help to avoid the supine position. The aim of this study is to detect the reliability of different devices on assessing sleeping position, comparing the data with objective evaluation by an infra-red camera. Methods: We compared the positional results of 4 healthy volunteers obtained from a type III PSG and with a neck-worn sleep position trainer (Night Shift - NS). Results: Data showed that NS is a good tool to assess the position of the trunk, with high rate of agreement with PSG, but in some conditions there are limitations, especially in detecting the real head and neck position and low accordance between NS data and information recorded by infra-red camera. Conclusions: Our study confirmed that more information about body position during sleep is needed, underling the necessity of developing new technologies that are able to better identify reciprocal body positions.","Affiliations 1 Ear-Nose-Throat & Audiology Unit, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. 2 Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck, Royal London Hospital, London, UK. 3 Department of Head-Neck Surgery, Otolaryngology, Head-Neck and Oral Surgery Unit, Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital, Forlì, Italy. 4 ENT MD freelancer, doctoral school in OSAS-EOS DRS, Milan, Italy.","Luca Cerritelli , Luigi Marco Stringa , Giulia Bianchi , Henry Zhang , Giovanni Cammaroto , Claudio Vicini , Stefano Pelucchi , Andrea Marco Minetti ",Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,2021 Dec,"Humans,Reproducibility of Results,Sleep,Sleep Apnea, Obstructive* / diagnosis",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928266
543,"Pregnancy Outcome after Vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery, a First Retrospective Observational Cohort Study","Study objective: Vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) is a novel minimal invasive surgical technique allowing a variety of gynecological procedures. The current literature describes improved patient comfort, improved better cosmetic results, and reduced operation time. This is a first study to assess pregnancy outcome after fertility-preserving vNOTES procedures. Design/Participants/Materials/Setting/Methods: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study including 125 patients under 43 years that underwent fertility-preserving vNOTES over a 5-year period (2014-2019). The gynecological surgical procedures included were vNOTES myomectomy, vNOTES salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy, vNOTES unilateral adnexectomy, and vNOTES cystectomy. A total of 26 pregnancies in 21 cases were observed, with deliveries between 2015 and 2020. Results: Retrospective analysis in this patient group showed that 18 pregnancies were diagnosed within 1 year after vNOTES (85.7%). Mean interval between surgery and pregnancy was 6 months. Fertility treatment was performed in 28.6%. In the 26 observed pregnancies, no vNOTES-related complications were observed and delivery was at term in all cases. Mode of delivery was a vaginal delivery in twenty cases (76.9% of total) of which 2 cases vacuum assisted (7.7%) and a Caesarean section in 6 cases (23.1% of total). Two cases of trial of labor after Caesarean are described after vNOTES surgery, both ended in an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. In case of vaginal delivery, the perineum was intact in 15%, a mediolateral episiotomy was performed in 50 and 35% a grade 1-2 perineal rupture was described. No grade 3-4 perineal ruptures are described. Limitations: A limitation of this study is the retrospective design which does not correct for confounding factors. Further larger multicenter studies are needed to validate these data. Conclusions: This is the first study describing pregnancy outcome after fertility-preserving vNOTES procedures. vNOTES did not affect the mode of delivery or cause pregnancy-related complications. vNOTES did not increase the risk of extensive perineal tears during vaginal delivery. These preliminary data show no adverse events when vNOTES is performed in women of reproductive age. Posterior colpotomy as performed in all vNOTES procedures is by itself not an indication for an elective Caesarean section.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium, ine.tavano@gmail.com. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Leuven Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. 3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium. 4 Department of Development and Regeneration, KU Leuven University, Leuven, Belgium.","Ine Tavano , Susanne Housmans , Jan Bosteels , Jan Baekelandt ",Gynecol Obstet Invest,2021,"Observational Study,Cesarean Section,Female,Humans,Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*,Retrospective Studies,Vagina",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34496368
544,A review of Australian Government funding of parenting intervention research,"Objectives: Parenting is central to children's optimal development and accounts for a substantial proportion of the variance in child outcomes, including up to 40% of child mental health. Parenting is also one of the most modifiable, proximal, and direct factors for preventing and treating a range of children's problems and enhancing wellbeing. To determine the effectiveness of new approaches to parenting intervention, and to evaluate how to optimise reach and uptake, sufficient funding must be allocated for high quality research. Method: We reviewed funding awarded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Australian Research Council (ARC) for parenting intervention research during 2011-2020. Results: Parenting intervention research received 0.25% of the NHMRC and ARC research budgets. Conclusions: There is a substantial mismatch between the funding of parenting intervention research and the impact of improved parenting on short- and long-term child outcomes. To rectify this, it is critical that Australian Government funding schemes include parenting interventions as priority areas for funding. Implications for public health: Changes in allocation of funding to parenting research will support the establishment of evidence for the effective development, implementation and dissemination of parenting interventions to maximise health outcomes for children and their families.","Affiliations 1 Mindful: Centre for Training and Research in Developmental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria. 2 Parenting and Family Support Centre, School of Psychology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland. 3 School of Psychology, MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development, Western Sydney University, Penrith, New South Wales. 4 Institute of Child Protection Studies, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne, Victoria. 5 Faculty of Law, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland. 6 Division of Psychology, School of Population Health, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia. 7 School of Applied Psychology & Menzies Health Institute of Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland. 8 Centre for Mental Health, School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria. 9 Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia. 10 School of Psychology, Faculty of Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales. 11 School of Applied Psychology & Applied Health Institute of Queensland, Griffith University, Brisbane, Queensland. 12 Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK. 13 Centre for Developmental Psychiatry and Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, School of Clinical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria. 14 School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Griffith University, Brisbane, Queensland. 15 Child and Youth Mental Health Service, Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Queensland. 16 School of Psychological Science, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia. 17 Thompson Institute, University of the Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast, Queensland. 18 School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Deakin University, Geelong, Victoria. 19 Centre for Child and Family Studies, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland. 20 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria. 21 School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria. 22 Judith Lumley Centre, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria.","Sophie S Havighurst , Carys Chainey , Frances L Doyle , Daryl J Higgins , Ben Mathews , Trevor G Mazzucchelli , Melanie Zimmer-Gembeck , Karl Andriessen , Vanessa E Cobham , Donna Cross , Mark R Dadds , Sharon Dawe , Kylie M Gray , Adam J Guastella , Paul Harnett , Divna M Haslam , Christel M Middeldorp , Alina Morawska , Jeneva L Ohan , Matthew R Sanders , Helen M Stallman , Bruce J Tonge , John W Toumbourou , Karen M T Turner , Kate E Williams , Marie B H Yap , Jan M Nicholson ",Aust N Z J Public Health,2022 Jun,"Review,Australia,Child,Government,Humans,Parenting* / psychology,Parents* / psychology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35436026

The last systematic review of the genus Curculigo was written in 2013, scientifically categorizing the phytochemistry and biological activities. Hitherto, the original compounds and their pharmacological activities were presented as the development of this genus, but there is not an updated review. To conclude the progression of the genus Curculigo, we collected the new literature published from 2013 to 2021 in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar databases, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. The novel chlorophenolic glucosides, curculigine, phenolic glycosides, orcinosides and polysaccharides were isolated from Curculigo. The new analyzing methods were established to control the quality of Curculigo as a herbal medicine. In addition, the pharmacological effects of Curculigo focused on anti-diabetes, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, osteoporosis, antioxidation, etc. The antitumor and neuroprotective activities were newly explored in recent years. The application of herbal medicine was gradually developed in scientific methods. The medicinal value of the genus Curculigo needs to further investigate its pharmacological mechanisms.

546,Predictive Factors of Toddlers' Sleep and Parental Stress,"Background: Although most infants consolidate their sleep habits during the first year of life, for many children, sleep is described as disrupted during toddlerhood. Along with individual child variables such as temperamental characteristics, parenting behaviors play a key role in determining children's sleep-wake patterns. The aims of the current study were to evaluate the relationship among toddlers' sleep quality, emotion regulation, bedtime routines, parental bedtime involvement, parental perceived social support and stress, and to integrate a novel combination of the aforementioned dimensions into predictive models of toddlers' sleep quality and parental stress. Methods: One hundred and sixty parents with 2-3-year-old children filled out the following self-report questionnaires: the Parent-Child Sleep Interaction Scale; the Emotion Regulation Checklist; the Social Provisions Scale; and an ad-hoc questionnaire to assess parental involvement in everyday and bedtime care for children. Three multiple regression analyses were conducted by regressing maternal and paternal parenting stress and infant's quality sleep onto the independent variables described above. Results: Toddlers' emotion regulation and parental psychosocial functioning were related to parental stress. Toddlers' night awakenings and the time required by toddlers to fall asleep were related to parental distress. Conclusions: The findings evidenced the bidirectional associations among the studied variables, highlighting the protective role of social support in reducing parenting stress and of paternal bedtime involvement in improving toddlers' sleep quality.","Affiliations 1 Department of Human Studies, LUMSA University, 00193 Rome, Italy. 2 Unit of Clinical Psychology, Department of Neuroscience and Neurorehabilitation, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, 00165 Rome, Italy.","Simona De Stasio , Francesca Boldrini , Benedetta Ragni , Simonetta Gentile ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020 Apr 6,"Adult,Child, Preschool,Fathers,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting,Parents* / psychology,Sleep*,Stress, Psychological*,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32268482
547,Participation in the Fathering through Change intervention reduces substance use among divorced and separated fathers,"Recent evaluations of parent training programs have demonstrated beneficial crossover effects in reducing parental substance use. Because divorce is associated with substance use risk and substance use interferes with effective parenting, parent training programs are critically important for divorced fathers but there are few evidence-based programs tailored to fathers. We tested whether an evidence-based parenting program would exhibit beneficial impact on fathers' substance use and whether these changes were mediated by changes in parenting efficacy. We tested hypotheses in a sample of 426 divorced and separated fathers randomly assigned to the online Fathering through Change (FTC) program or the wait-listed control condition. Models specified as 3-month pre-post analyses of self-reported substance use. The FTC was associated with reductions in total substance use (d = 0.14) and drinking (d = 0.26) but not with reductions in tobacco smoking and marijuana use. Data also supported a significant indirect effect for FTC through pre-post changes in parenting efficacy (d = 0.36). We discuss clinical implications for the integration of parent training within substance use treatment.","Affiliations 1 Prevention Science Institute, University of Oregon, 1600 Millrace Dr., Eugene, OR 97403, United States. 2 Prevention Science Institute, University of Oregon, 1600 Millrace Dr., Eugene, OR 97403, United States.

549,Are subjective sleepiness and sleep quality related to prospective memory?,"Event-based prospective memory (PM) involves carrying out intentions when specific events occur and is ubiquitous in everyday life. It consists of a prospective component (remembering that something must be done) and a retrospective component (remembering what must be done and when). Subjective sleep-related variables may be related to PM performance and an attention-demanding prospective component. In two studies, the relationship of subjective sleepiness and subjective sleep quality with both PM components was investigated with a laboratory PM task and separation of its components via Bayesian multinomial processing tree modeling. In Study 1, neither component of PM was related to naturally occurring subjective sleepiness or sleep quality. In Study 2, sleepiness was experimentally increased by placing some participants in a supine body posture. Testing participants in upright vs. supine posture affected neither PM component. However, body posture moderated the relationship between subjective sleep quality and the prospective component: In supine posture, subjective sleep quality tended to be more positively related to the prospective component. Overall, neither subjective sleepiness nor subjective sleep quality alone was related to PM.","Affiliations 1 Institute for Experimental Psychology, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Gebäude 23.02, Universitätsstraße 1, 40225, Düsseldorf, Germany. mateja.boehm@hhu.de. 2 Institute for Experimental Psychology, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Gebäude 23.02, Universitätsstraße 1, 40225, Düsseldorf, Germany.","Mateja F Böhm , Ute J Bayen , Marie Luisa Schaper ",Cogn Res Princ Implic,2020 Feb 7,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Female,Humans,Male,Memory, Episodic*,Posture / physiology*,Sleep / physiology*,Sleepiness*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32034561
550,The flower head of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. (Juhua): A paradigm of flowers serving as Chinese dietary herbal medicine,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dietary herbal medicines are widely used for the prevention and treatment of a variety of diseases due to their pharmacological activities in China. Juhua (the flower head of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.), the most representative flower-derived one, which is mainly used for the treatment of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, shows significant activities, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer, and, neuroprotective, as well as effects on the cardiovascular system. Aims of this review: This review aims to provide an overview of the crucial roles of flowers in Chinese dietary herbal medicine, and the pharmaceutical research progress of Juhua (the paradigm of dietary herbal medicine derived from the flower) including its applications in Traditional Chinese medicine and diet, cultivars, phytochemistry, quality control, pharmacology, and toxicity, along with chrysanthemum breeding and biotechnology. Method: The information associated with Chinese dietary herbal medicine, flower-derived medicine, dietary flower, and pharmaceutical research of Juhua, was collected from government reports, classic books of Traditional Chinese medicine, the thesis of doctors of philosophy and maters, and database including Pubmed, Scifinder, Web of Science, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Internet; and others. Result: All flower-originated crude medicines recorded in Chinese pharmacopeia and their applications were summarized for the first time in this paper. The edible history and development of flowers in China, the theory of Chinese dietary herbal medicines, as well as flowers serving as dietary herbal medicines, were discussed. Moreover, applications in Traditional Chinese medicine and diet, cultivars, phytochemistry, quality control, pharmacology, and safety evaluation of Juhua, together with chrysanthemum breeding and biotechnology, were summarized in this paper. Conclusion: The theory of dietary herbal medicines, which are an important part of the Traditional Chinese medicine system, has a history of thousands of years. Many herbal flowers, serving as dietary herbal medicines, contribute significantly to the prevention and treatment of a variety of diseases for Chinese people. To better benefit human health, more effective supervision practice for dietary herbal medicines is needed. Although various investigations on Juhua have been done, there is a lack of analytical methods for discrimination of cultivar flowers and identification of authenticity. Research on the major compounds with bioactivities, especially those related to its clinical application or healthcare function, as well as their possible mechanize, need be strengthened. More safety evaluation of Juhua should be carried out. The research limitations Juhua is facing exist in all dietary herbal medicine.","Affiliations 1 TCM and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Innovative Material Medical Research Institute, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410208, China. 2 TCM and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Innovative Material Medical Research Institute, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, 410208, China.

551,Maternal and fetal outcomes of Asian pregnancies after bariatric surgery,"Introduction: Obesity is a risk factor for pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and large gestational age pregnancy. Bariatric surgery is widely accepted to treat obesity but associated with small for gestational age fetuses. Objective: To report maternal and fetal outcomes after bariatric surgery in morbidly obese Asian females. Setting: University Hospital, Singapore. Methods: We maintain a prospective cohort of patients who underwent bariatric surgery in our institution. Maternal and fetal outcomes are compared with a control group of 31 pregnancies matched for age, parity, presurgery weight, and year of delivery. Results: Twenty-four pregnancies occurred in 16 patients in our postoperative cohort. Morbidly obese women in the control group were more likely to develop gestational diabetes (19.3% versus 5.0%, P = .150) and pregnancy-induced hypertension/preeclampsia (32.2% versus 0%, P = .003) compared with the postoperative group. Of fetuses, 37.5% in the bariatric group had low birth weight compared with only 9.4% fetuses in the control group (P = .016). Preoperative body mass index, short interval between conception and surgery, and poor weight gain during pregnancy did not predict for small for gestational age fetuses. Subsequent weights were available for 37.5% of the children in the surgical cohort and none of these children exhibited growth retardation. Conclusion: Bariatric surgery lowers the risk of maternal co-morbidities and large gestational age fetus during pregnancy. Asians are at high risk of small for gestational age pregnancies after bariatric surgery and should undergo close monitoring for fetal growth throughout their pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Surgery, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore. 2 Department of Surgery, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore; Department of Surgery, Jurong Health Campus, National University Health System, Singapore. 3 Department of Surgery, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore; Department of Surgery, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore. 4 Department of Surgery, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore.

553,Relationship between parenting measures and parents and child psychopathological symptoms: a cross-sectional study,"Background: Increasing evidence suggests a complex role of family influences, such as the exposure to parent psychopathology through parenting behavior, in parent-to-child psychopathology transmission. Parenting behaviour could represent a relevant target of psychoeducative intervention. Given these premises, we aimed to evaluate homotypic and heterotypic relationships between parent and child psychopathology, mediated by parenting behaviours, taking into account the constructs of parent and offspring internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Methods: Internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 272 clinically-referred subjects (mean age = 14.5 ± 2.3; F = 23.5%) and their parents (mothers n = 272, fathers n = 242) were assessed through the Child Behavior Checklist and the Adult Self Report; four areas of parenting behaviours were investigated through the Family Life Questionnaire. Multiple mediation models were built, considering mother and father psychopathology scales as independent variables, parenting measures and family functioning as mediators (Affirmation, Rules, Discipline and Special Allowances), child psychopathology scales as dependent variables and demographic variables as covariates. Results: Regression models showed a significant effect of maternal internalizing symptomatology on child externalizing behavioral problems; high levels of maternal pathology predicted high levels of children's psychopathology. A total mediating effect of parenting measures was found: high levels of internalizing symptoms in mothers predicted low levels of affirmation, which in turn predicted high levels of externalizing psychopathology in children. Conclusions: Our study results confirmed the existence of interdependent links between mothers' psychiatric symptomatology, parenting behaviour and offspring outcomes, specifically in an Italian context. On a clinical and rehabilitation basis, this work offers suggestions about parenting practices, specifically maternal, involved in the maintenance of child psychopathology.","Affiliations 1 Scientific Institute, IRCCS E.

554,A survey of herbal medicines as tumor microenvironment-modulating agents,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is extremely complex, involving extensive interactions among stromal cells, immune cells, and signaling molecules. Therefore, an approach targeting the TME has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Herbal medicines consist of multiple active compounds, which have multi-target effects. Therefore, they have been regarded as potential anticancer agents; multiple studies have explored their effects on the TME. In this review, we report the effects of 29 single herb medicines or herbal formulas on the TME, based on the findings of 64 published studies. Specifically, we describe the effects of these herbal medicines on cancer-associated fibroblasts/tumor-associated fibroblasts, tumor-associated endothelial cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and tumor-associated macrophages. Among the reviewed herbal medicines, the most promising TME-modulating effects were exhibited by curcumin, DHA, EGCG, resveratrol, and silibinin; these medicines showed the ability to regulate two or more components of the TME. The findings of this review support the notion that the combination of herbal medicines with conventional anticancer therapies are likely to exhibit a clinical benefit, which should be further explored in clinical trials.","Affiliations 1 Dept. of Clinical Oncology, Cheonan Korean Medicine Hospital of Daejeon University, Cheonan-si, Republic of Korea. 2 Liver and Immunology Research Center, Dunsan Korean Medicine Hospital of Daejeon University, Daejeon-si, Republic of Korea. 3 Dept. of Internal Medicine, Graduated School of Korean Medicine, University of Daejeon, Daejeon-si, Republic of Korea.","Chan-Ran Park , Jin-Seok Lee , Chang-Gue Son , Nam-Hun Lee ",Phytother Res,2021 Jan,"Review,Antineoplastic Agents / pharmacology,Antineoplastic Agents / therapeutic use*,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Neoplasms / drug therapy*,Tumor Microenvironment / drug effects*,Antineoplastic Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32658314
555,Macro- and microvascular reactivity during repetitive exposure to shortened sleep: sex differences,"Epidemiological studies have reported strong association between sleep loss and hypertension with unknown mechanisms. This study investigated macrovascular and microcirculation changes and inflammatory markers during repetitive sleep restriction. Sex differences were also explored. Forty-five participants completed a 22-day in-hospital protocol. Participants were assigned to, (1) eight-hour sleep per night (control), or (2) sleep restriction (SR) condition: participants slept from 0300 to 0700 h for three nights followed by a recovery night of 8-h sleep, repeated four times. Macrocirculation assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and microcirculation reactivity tests were performed at baseline, last day of each experimental block and during recovery at the end. Cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory marker levels were measured in blood samples. No duration of deprivation (SR block) by condition interaction effects were found for FMD, microcirculation, norepinephrine, cell adhesion molecules, IL-6 or IL-8. However, when men and women were analyzed separately, there was a statistical trend (p = 0.08) for increased IL-6 across SR blocks in women, but not in men. Interestingly, men showed a significant progressive (dose dependent) increase in skin vasodilatation (p = 0.02). A novel and unexpected finding was that during the recovery period, men that had been exposed to repeated SR blocks had elevated IL-8 and decreased norepinephrine. Macrocirculation, microcirculation, cell adhesion molecules, and markers of inflammation appeared to be resistant to this model of short-term repetitive exposures to the blocks of shortened sleep in healthy sleepers. However, men and women responded differently, with women showing mild inflammatory response and men showing more vascular system sensitivity to the repetitive SR.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. 2 Department of Surgery, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. 3 Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA. 4 Department of Medicine, University of Florida College of Medicine - Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL.","Huan Yang , Dimitrios Baltzis , Vrushank Bhatt , Monika Haack , Hans K Meier-Ewert , Shiva Gautam , Aristidis Veves , Janet M Mullington ",Sleep,2021 May 14,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Biomarkers,Female,Humans,Male,Sex Characteristics*,Sleep,Sleep Deprivation*,Biomarkers",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33249482
556,Learning Monologues at Bedtime Improves Sleep Quality in Actors and Non-Actors,"Several studies show that pre-sleep learning determines changes in subsequent sleep, including improvements of sleep quality. Our aims were to confirm this finding using a more ecological task (learning a theatrical monologue) and to investigate whether the effect is modulated by expertise. Using a mixed design, we compared polysomnographic recordings of baseline sleep (BL, 9-h TIB) to those of post-training sleep (TR, with the same TIB but preceded by the training session), in one group of actors (N = 11) and one of non-actors (N = 11). In both groups, TR appears reorganized and re-compacted by the learning session, as shown, among others, by a significant decrease of WASO%, awakenings, arousals, and state transitions and by a trend towards an increased number of complete cycles and total cycle time. Concerning memory performance, the number of synonyms produced was significantly higher in the morning relative to immediate recall. No between-groups differences emerged either for sleep or memory variables. Our data confirm pre-sleep learning's beneficial effect on sleep quality in an ecological context. While expertise appears not to influence memory-related sleep mechanisms, results on morning recall support the recent view that sleep's role in memory processes consists in trace ""transformation"" for adaptive purposes, rather than rote consolidation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Campania L.

557,Sleep Disruption and Bone Health,"Purpose of review: Review recent literature investigating the relationship between bone health and sleep/circadian disruptions (e.g., abnormal sleep duration, night shift work). Recent findings: Short and long sleep are associated with low bone mineral density (BMD). Recent data from observational studies identified an increased risk of fracture in women with short sleep. Studies suggest that age, sex, weight change, and concurrent circadian misalignment may modify the effects of sleep restriction on bone metabolism. Interventional studies demonstrate alterations in bone metabolism and structure in response to circadian disruption that could underlie the increased fracture risk seen with night shift work. The effects of sleep and circadian disruption during adolescence may have lifelong skeletal consequences if they adversely impact bone modeling. Data suggest that short sleep and night shift work negatively impact bone metabolism and health. Rigorous studies of prevalent sleep and circadian disruptions are needed to determine mechanisms and develop prevention strategies to optimize lifelong skeletal health.","Affiliation 1 Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, 12801 E. 17th Ave., Mail Stop 8106, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.

558,The Effects of a Nutrition Education Intervention on Sports Nutrition Knowledge during a Competitive Season in Highly Trained Adolescent Swimmers,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a seven-week nutrition education intervention on the sports nutrition knowledge (SNK) of highly trained UK adolescent swimmers. Fifteen national and international adolescent swimmers (males = 5; females = 10, 15.5 ± 1.1 years, 170.2 ± 7.5 cm, 60.3 ± 5.7 kg) participated in the study during seven consecutive weeks of the competitive swimming season. The participants received 30 min of nutrition education once per week in a classroom-based setting after they had completed their regular swim training. An undergraduate sports nutrition student delivered all nutrition education sessions and SNK questionnaires were administered to the participants pre- and post-intervention. The mean total SNK score improved by 8.3% (SD = 8.4%, 95% CI = 4.1-12.6; p = 0.006; ES = 1.0) following the nutrition education sessions. On an individual basis, ten swimmers significantly improved their total SNK score, whereas four swimmers did not improve, and one swimmer performed significantly worse after the intervention. Moreover, the swimmers' knowledge of hydration improved by 22.2% (SD = 20.6%, 95% CI = 11.8-32.6, p = 0.004, ES = 1.1) over the seven-week timeframe, which was the only nutrition topic to have a significantly increased knowledge score. The current study therefore suggests that a nutrition education intervention can positively influence the SNK of highly trained adolescent swimmers.","Affiliations 1 Research Centre for Life and Sport Science (CLaSS), School of Health Sciences, Birmingham City University, Birmingham B9 3TN, UK. 2 Human Sciences Research Centre, University of Derby, Derby DE1 1GB, UK. 3 Department of Physical Therapy, College of Applied Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60007, USA. 4 Sports Nutrition and Performance Research Group, Department of Sport and Physical Activity, Edge Hill University, Ormskirk L39 4QP, UK.","Wee Lun Foo , Mark A Faghy , Andy Sparks , Josh W Newbury , Lewis A Gough ",Nutrients,2021 Aug 6,"Adolescent,Athletes / education*,Athletes / psychology,Competitive Behavior,Cross-Sectional Studies,Diet, Healthy*,Dietary Supplements,Energy Intake,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Humans,Male,Nutritional Sciences / education*,Nutritional Status,Nutritive Value,Physical Conditioning, Human*,Recommended Dietary Allowances,Swimming*,United Kingdom",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34444873
559,Recent Analytical Method for Detection of Chemical Adulterants in Herbal Medicine,"Herbal medicine has become popular in recent years as an alternative medicine. The problem arises when herbal medicines contain an undeclared synthetic drug that is illegally added, since it is a natural product that does not contain any chemical drugs due to the potential cause of harmful effects. Supervision of herbal medicines is important to ensure that these herbal medicines are still safe to use. Thus, developing a reliable analytical technique for the determination of adulterated drugs in herbal medicine is gaining interest. This review aims to provide a recent analytical method that has been used within the past 5 years (2016-2021) for the determination of chemical adulterants in herbal medicine.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung 45363, Indonesia. 2 Drug Development Study Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung 45363, Indonesia.","Rimadani Pratiwi , Ratu Hanifa Fayza Dipadharma , Ishmat Jati Prayugo , Olivia Angelina Layandro ",Molecules,2021 Oct 31,"Review,Chromatography, Gas,Chromatography, Liquid,Herbal Medicine*,Pharmaceutical Preparations / analysis*,Pharmaceutical Preparations",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34771013

We conducted a cross-sectional general population survey of 1,599 parents who were primary caregivers to a child aged 10 or younger and follow-up interviews with 23 parents who responded ""yes"" to one of the questions about alcohol use causing harm their child. Survey data were analyzed using multilevel logistic models. Compared to abstainers, parents who drank at least once a year were less likely to report that someone else's drinking caused a lack of supervision or physical harm to their child. Higher continued volumes of drinking were related to fewer reports of not watching a child closely enough. Social companionship support (having people to go out with) was related to greater odds that a parent's drinking would cause physical harm to his or her child(ren). In the qualitative analysis, four relevant themes emerged: perceived effects of alcohol use, tangible support and child supervision, immediate and distal harm, and turning points in drinking behaviors.","Affiliations 1 College of Social Work, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. 2 Division of Social Work, California State University, Sacramento, CA, USA. 3 The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. 4 Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.","Bridget Freisthler , Jennifer Price Wolf , Ashleigh I Hodge , Yiwen Cao ",Child Maltreat,2020 Aug,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Alcohol Drinking / epidemiology,Alcohol Drinking / psychology*,Child,Child Abuse / psychology*,Child Abuse / statistics & numerical data*,Child, Preschool,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Male,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31594395

We used feminist ethnographic research methods which focus on the narratives of young women and their social networks to understand this phenomenon. Looking at the issue from the adolescent girls' perspective reveals that such pregnancies have always existed, and their continued existence can be attributed to local sociocultural perceptions of fertility, pregnancy, and marriage. We show that the young mothers continue with their lives without being labeled as social outcasts and that they are supported by family networks. Social policies intended to provide health services need to restructure those services based on a culturally sensitive model outlined in this article.","Affiliations 1 Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel. 2 Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Sede Boqer Campus, Israel.","Tebo Kgosiemang , Pnina Motzafi-Haller ",Qual Health Res,2021 Dec,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome*,Adolescent,Botswana,Female,Health Services,Humans,Marriage,Mothers,Pregnancy,Pregnancy in Adolescence*,Sexual Behavior",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34612736
562,Are pregnancies with lupus but without APS of good prognosis?,"Background: Pregnancies in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at risk of unfavorable perinatal outcomes, especially when antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is present. Their prognosis is less clear in other situations. Objectives: To assess pregnancy prognosis in women with SLE but not APS compared with a control series and determine the poor prognostic factors, if any, detectable before 15 weeks' gestation. Material and methods: This retrospective case-control study included 137 women with SLE, including 114 without APS, and 274 control women. Unfavorable perinatal outcome was defined by perinatal death (≥ 22 weeks of gestation) or preterm delivery ≤35 weeks. Results: Pregnancies of the 114 women with SLE but not APS were at more than twice the risk of unfavorable perinatal outcomes compared with those in the control group (18/114 (15.8%) vs 21/274 (7.7%), OR 2.3, 95% 1.1-4.7). After logistic regression, three factors detectable before 15 weeks were associated with an unfavorable perinatal outcome: i. proteinuria and/or hypertension (in 19.3% of the pregnancies) ii. lack of cutaneous lupus (26.3%), and iii. a history of thrombocytopenia-leukopenia-anemia (19.3%). When these factors were absent, the risk of a poor perinatal outcome was very low (3.3%) but increased strongly for pregnancies with one (22.2%) or at least two (44.4%) of these factors. Conclusion: Among women with SLE but not APS in the first trimester, only the presence of risk factors increases the likelihood of an unfavorable perinatal outcome. Precis: Pregnancies with SLE but not APS are at risk of unfavorable perinatal outcomes only if risk factors are present.","Affiliations 1 Hopital d'Arras, Pôle Mère Enfant, F-62000 Arras, France.

563,Modifiable parental factors in adolescent sleep: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Sleep problems are prevalent during adolescence, but parents may be able to support adolescents to sleep better. A systematic search of records from six databases from inception up to November 2019, identified 103 peer-reviewed publications that examined behaviourally and cognitively modifiable parental factors associated with sleep in adolescents aged 12-18 years. Although included studies were largely cross-sectional and heterogeneous, with heavy reliance on self-reported measures, associations with sound, convergent levels of evidence were found for: 1) parental rule-setting for bedtimes and parent sleep behaviours with longer sleep duration in adolescents; 2) healthy parent sleep and family functioning with better adolescent sleep quality; and 3) parental warmth with better adolescent daytime functioning. Effect sizes were in the small to moderate range. The identified parental factors are recommended targets for inclusion in parenting programs to support adolescent sleep, however, would require validation in intervention studies. Opportunities for research are outlined for the identified parental factors, sleep domains with limited evidence, and better understanding the mechanisms or possible moderators in the associations between parental factors and sleep outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Australia. 2 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Australia; School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Australia.

564,Disentangling the Direction of Associations between Sleep and Temperament in Toddlers,"Objectives/background: Although much research has investigated the associations between children's sleep and their temperament, the direction of these associations remains unclear, largely due to a lack of longitudinal studies with repeated assessments of both sleep and temperament. Aiming to clarify the temporal precedence of these two constructs, the current study investigated reciprocal associations between toddlers' sleep and temperament with a longitudinal design. Participants: The sample consisted of 82 toddlers (39 girls) assessed twice. Methods: At both 2 (M = 25.23 months; SD = 1.11) and 3 years of age (M = 36.81 months; SD = 0.91), toddlers' sleep duration and quality were assessed using actigraphy and their temperament was reported by their mothers with the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire. Results: Shorter nighttime sleep duration (ß = - .28, p = .03) and lower sleep efficiency (ß = - .33, p = .01) at 2 years predicted more temperamental proneness to anger at 3 years, while greater temperamental social fear at 2 years was predictive of shorter 24-hour (ß = - .44, p = .02) and nighttime (ß = - .36, p = .04) sleep duration at 3 years. Associations between temperamental activity level and sleep variables were non-significant. Conclusion: The direction of the associations between toddlers' sleep and their temperament may vary according to which dimension of temperament is considered.

Ten years of experience,"Introduction: Despite the ever-improving medical care, pregnancies of women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are at increased risk of complications for both mother and child. Optimal compensation of diabetes before and during pregnancy is an essential protective factor reducing the risk of congenital malformations, pregnancy loss, and other complications. The pregnancy of women with T1DM should be planned, ideally at a time of optimal diabetes compensation. Target glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values until the range of 42-48 mmol/mol should be achieved at least three months before pregnancy. Our work aimed to evaluate the perinatal results of pregnancies in women with T1DM and the eff ect of preconception counseling and adequate T1DM compensation before pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. Methods and results: Retrospective analysis of pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of women with T1DM were followed up at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, General University Hospital in Prague and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University between 2008 to 2018. A total of 221 women with T1DM were included in the analysis. Adequate (HbA1c 48 mmol/mol at least 3 months before conception) and inadequate diabetes compensation at the beginning of the pregnancy had 59 (26.7%) and 162 (72.3%) women, respectively. Pregnancies of women with adequate diabetes compensation were more often planned (55.9 vs. 24.7%; P 95th percentile; 22.0 vs. 35.8%; P = 0.027). Conclusion: The pregnancy of women with T1DM is burdened by a number of perinatal and neonatal complications. In the study group, most women with T1DM became pregnant unintentionally at a time of inadequate diabetes compensation. Women who achieved adequate diabetes compensation before pregnancy had a lower incidence of perinatal complications. Therefore, it is advised that women with T1DM should plan their pregnancy, attend preconception and antenatal care, and give birth in perinatal centers, which provide coordinated care from diabetologists, gynecologists, obstetricians, and neonatologists.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Kateřina Anderlová, Hana Krejčí, Antonín Pařízek, Martin Haluzík, Michal Kršek, Vratislav Krejčí, Dana Benešová, Patrik Šimják",Ceska Gynekol,2021,"Adult,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1* / complications,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Preconception Care,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy in Diabetics*,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34736329
566,The impact of sleeping duration on atherosclerosis in the community: insights from the Corinthia study,"Purpose: Sleep is an essential physiologic process whose disturbances have been regarded as a risk factor in various pathophysiologic processes, including atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Although the negative influence of short sleep duration has been well-established, recent data suggest a possible harmful effect of prolonged sleeping pattern. Methods: In the setting of the Corinthia cross-sectional study, self-reported night sleep duration was recorded in 1752 apparently healthy individuals and was classified as normal sleep duration (NSD, 7-8 h), short sleep duration (SSD, 6-7 h), very short sleep duration (VSSD, < 6 h), and long sleep duration (LSD, > 8 h). Carotid duplex ultrasonography was performed in order to measure the mean and maximum carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) as a non-invasive marker of atherosclerosis. Results: Subjects with LSD and VSSD had significantly higher mean cIMT (VSSD: 1.02 ± 0.45 mm, SSD: 0.95 ± 0.35, NSD: 0.96 ± 0.38 mm, LSD: 1.07 ± 0.52 mm; p < 0.001) and maximum cIMT (VSSD: 1.39 ± 0.9 mm, SSD: 1.25 ± 0.71 mm, NSD: 1.23 ± 0.76 mm, LSD: 1.41 ± 0.93 mm). Following a regression analysis adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors, individuals with LSD and VSSD had higher mean cIMT by 0.054 mm and 0.067 mm respectively compared to those with NSD. Conclusion: A balanced sleeping duration of 6-8 h is associated with decreased mean and maximum IMT while both very short sleep duration and long sleep duration are associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis.","Affiliations 1 1st Cardiology Clinic, 'Hippokration' General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 115 28, Athens, Greece. 2 1st Cardiology Clinic, 'Hippokration' General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 115 28, Athens, Greece. gvogiatz@yahoo.gr.","Evangelos Oikonomou # , Panagiotis Theofilis # , Georgia Vogiatzi , George Lazaros , Sotirios Tsalamandris , Vasiliki Chara Mystakidi , Athina Goliopoulou , Maria Anastasiou , Petros Fountoulakis , Christos Chasikidis , Evangelia Christoforatou , Dimitris Tousoulis ",Sleep Breath,2021 Dec,"Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Atherosclerosis / epidemiology*,Carotid Intima-Media Thickness,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Greece / epidemiology,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Sleep* / physiology,Time Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33411185
567,A system for reporting and evaluating adverse drug reactions of herbal medicine in Taiwan from 1998 to 2016,"The Taiwan Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting System for Herbal Medicine (TADRRS-HM) has systematically documented suspected adverse events from adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports from 1998 (prior to its formal establishment in 2001) and evaluates safety profiles of herbal medicines. This article describes findings from 2079 ADR reports filed between 1998 and 2016: 941 reports involved single herbs and 87 involved folk herbals; 842 were generated from clinical trials, while 209 ADR reports involving foods, health foods, dietary supplement foods and herbal cuisine were grouped as Other. Severity assessments using the Modified Hartwig and Siegel scale classified 72.4% of ADRs as mild, 17.4% as moderate and 6.5% as severe. System Organ Class classification of the ADRs identified gastrointestinal system disorders as the most common (33.4%), followed by skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (21.2%). The TADRRS-HM records indicate that herbal medicines may cause a wide range of ADRs. Aconiti Radix, Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang, and Datura suaveolens were the most commonly reported single herb, herbal formula, and folk herbal, respectively. The data indicate that herbal medicines may cause a wide range of ADRs. This system will confer long-term benefits for the development of Taiwan's herbal medicines adverse reaction database and facilitate epidemiological analysis.","Affiliations 1 Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, and Chinese Medicine Research Center, China Medical University, No. 91, Hsueh-Shih Road, North District, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan, ROC. tcmchh55@gmail.com. 2 Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. tcmchh55@gmail.com. 3 School of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. 4 Department of Public Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. 5 Division of Chinese Internal Medicine, Department of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. 6 School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan. 7 Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. 8 Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy, Taipei City Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. 9 Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. 10 School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. 11 Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chinese Medicine Department, China Medicine University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. 12 Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy, Chang Gung Medical Foundation, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. 13 Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, and Chinese Medicine Research Center, China Medical University, No. 91, Hsueh-Shih Road, North District, Taichung, 40402, Taiwan, ROC. 14 Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, College of Computer Science, Asia University, No. 500, Lioufeng Road, Wufeng, Taichung, 41354, Taiwan, ROC. htchu@asia.edu.tw.","Hen-Hong Chang , Su-Yin Chiang , Pei-Chun Chen , Chia-Han Tsai , Rong-Chi Yang , Chiu-Lin Tsai , Tsung-Hsiu Wu , Yow-Wen Hsieh , Yu-Chun Lin , Yung-Te Kuo , Kuan-Chung Chen , Hsueh-Ting Chu ",Sci Rep,2021 Nov 2,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems / statistics & numerical data*,Databases, Factual*,Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions / etiology,Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions / pathology*,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Pharmacovigilance,Phytotherapy / adverse effects*,Plants, Medicinal / adverse effects*,Skin Diseases / etiology,Skin Diseases / pathology*,Taiwan,Time Factors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728662
568,Outcomes of pregnancies using donor sperm compared with those using partner sperm: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Registry data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) show an increase of 40% in IUI and 377% in IVF cases using donor sperm between 2006 and 2016. Objective and rationale: The objective of this study was to establish whether pregnancies conceived using donor sperm are at higher risk of obstetric and perinatal complications than those conceived with partner sperm. As more treatments are being carried out using donor sperm, attention is being given to obstetric and perinatal outcomes, as events in utero and at delivery have implications for long-term health. There is a need to know if there is any difference in the outcomes of pregnancies between those conceived using donor versus partner sperm in order to adequately inform and counsel couples. Search methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcomes of pregnancies conceived using donor sperm compared with partner sperm. Searches were performed in the OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases, including all studies published before 11 February 2019. The search strategy involved search terms for pregnancy, infant, donor sperm, heterologous artificial insemination, donor gametes, pregnancy outcomes and perinatal outcomes. Studies were included if they assessed pregnancies conceived by any method using, or infants born from, donor sperm compared with partner sperm and described early pregnancy, obstetric or perinatal outcomes. The Downs and Black tool was used for quality and bias assessment of studies. Outcomes: Of 3391 studies identified from the search, 37 studies were included in the review and 36 were included in the meta-analysis. For pregnancies conceived with donor sperm, versus partner sperm, there was an increase in the relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of combined hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: 1.44 (1.17-1.78), pre-eclampsia: 1.49 (1.05-2.09) and small for gestational age (SGA): 1.42 (1.17-1.79) but a reduced risk of ectopic pregnancy: 0.69 (0.48-0.98). There was no difference in the overall RR (95% CI) of miscarriage: 0.94 (0.80-1.11), gestational diabetes: 1.49 (0.62-3.59), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH): 1.24 (0.87-1.76), placental abruption: 0.65 (0.04-10.37), placenta praevia: 1.19 (0.64-2.21), preterm birth: 0.98 (0.88-1.08), low birth weight: 0.97 (0.82-1.15), high birthweight: 1.28 (0.94-1.73): large for gestational age (LGA): 1.01 (0.84-1.22), stillbirth: 1.23 (0.97-1.57), neonatal death: 0.79 (0.36-1.73) and congenital anomaly: 1.15 (0.86-1.53). Wider implications: The majority of our findings are reassuring, except for the mild increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and SGA in pregnancies resulting from donor sperm. However, the evidence for this is limited and should be interpreted with caution because the evidence was based on observational studies which varied in their quality and risk of bias. Further high-quality population-based studies reporting obstetric outcomes in detail are required to confirm these findings.","Affiliations 1 Aberdeen Fertility Centre, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB25 2ZL, UK. 2 Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB25 2ZL, UK. 3 Aberdeen Fertility Centre, Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, Aberdeen AB25 2ZL, UK.","Christopher P Allen , Nicola Marconi , David J McLernon , Sohinee Bhattacharya , Abha Maheshwari ",Hum Reprod Update,2021 Jan 4,"Meta-Analysis,Systematic Review,Female,Fertilization in Vitro*,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Male,Placenta,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Premature Birth* / epidemiology,Spermatozoa",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33057599
569,Antiseizure medications and oral contraceptives: Impact of enzyme inducers on pregnancy outcomes and costs,"Purpose: To show the impact of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) associated with co-administration of enzyme-inducing (EI) antiseizure medications and oral contraceptives (OCs) on the annual number of unintended pregnancies, their outcomes, and their associated costs in the United States (US). Methods: A Microsoft Excel pregnancy-outcomes model was developed to determine the impact of DDIs in women who take an OC as well as an EI antiseizure medication known to lower the effectiveness of the OC in preventing pregnancy. The model compared the number of unintended pregnancies, the expected pregnancy outcomes, and associated costs in women taking an OC and an EI medication with a matched cohort of women who took an OC and an enzyme-neutral (EN) antiseizure medication that is known not to interact with OCs. The model perspectives were patients and third-party payers in the US. Unintended pregnancy rates, pregnancy outcomes, and cost inputs for the model were taken from published studies. Results: The results of the analysis showed an estimated increase in the annual number of unintended pregnancies in the US of 503 (a change from 1151 to 1654), an increase of 44.7%, for the estimated 71,922 women currently taking an OC plus an EI medication in the US when compared with a matched cohort taking an OC plus an EN medication. This resulted in an estimated annual healthcare cost increase of $3 million, which is an increase of 5.5% in the annual costs for contraception and pregnancy care. A scenario analysis showed that the annual number of unintended pregnancies could be lower (575 vs 1654) for a matched cohort of women taking EI medications and using a copper intrauterine device, a highly effective and nonhormonal form of contraception, rather than an OC. Conclusions: Physicians treating women of reproductive age for epilepsy who wish to avoid pregnancy should consider the potential for DDIs that might result in unintended pregnancies. Thus, physicians should alert women using EI medications for epilepsy control to the increased potential for unintended pregnancies if they use OCs for contraception.","Affiliations 1 RTI Health Solutions, 3040 Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.

570,Mechanism of herbal medicine on hypertensive nephropathy (Review),"Hypertensive nephropathy is the most common complication of hypertension, and is one of the main causes of end‑stage renal disease (ESRD) in numerous countries. The basic pathological feature of hypertensive nephropathy is arteriolosclerosis followed by renal parenchymal damage. The etiology of this disease is complex, and its pathogenesis is mainly associated with renal hemodynamic changes and vascular remodeling. Despite the increased knowledge on the pathogenesis of hypertensive nephropathy, the current clinical treatment methods are still not effective in preventing the development of the disease to ESRD. Herbal medicine, which is used to relieve symptoms, can improve hypertensive nephropathy through multiple targets. Since there are few clinical studies on the treatment of hypertensive nephropathy with herbal medicine, this article aims to review the progress on the basic research on the treatment of hypertensive nephropathy with herbal medicine, including regulation of the renin angiotensin system, inhibition of sympathetic excitation, antioxidant stress and anti‑inflammatory protection of endothelial cells, and improvement of obesity‑associated factors. Herbal medicine with different components plays a synergistic and multi‑target role in the treatment of hypertensive nephropathy. The description of the mechanism of herbal medicine in the treatment of hypertensive nephropathy will contribute towards the progress of modern medicine.","Affiliations 1 Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, P.R.

571,"Maternal parentification history impacts evaluative cognitions about self, parenting, and child","Parentification occurs when children are unfairly charged with fulfilling parental instrumental and emotional needs. Parentification is associated with risk to evaluative self cognitions from childhood to emerging adulthood, but this association has not yet been studied among parents. The transition to parenthood is typically characterized by declines in self-esteem, suggesting it is a critical period for understanding the risk parentification history poses to evaluative self-cognitions and evaluative cognitions about children. The present study addresses these gaps using longitudinal data (N = 374 first-time mothers) to examine the influence of maternal parentification history domains (emotional and instrumental caregiving, role unfairness) on trajectories of maternal evaluative cognitions about the self (self-esteem, parenting self-efficacy) and about the child (difficult child temperament, dissatisfaction with child contributions to relationships) in early parenthood. A spillover model was also examined such that evaluative cognitions about the self were examined as potential mediators between parentification history and evaluative cognitions about children. Results support associations between the role unfairness domain of parentification and each domain of maternal evaluative cognitions and a significant indirect effect of unfairness on risk to maternal evaluative cognitions about child contributions via parenting self-efficacy. Implications for mother-child relationships and processes of intergenerational transmission of parentification are discussed.","Affiliations 1 Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA. 2 Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA. 3 Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, USA.","Amy K Nuttall , Alexandra L Ballinger , Alytia A Levendosky , John G Borkowski ",Infant Ment Health J,2021 May,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Child,Cognition,Female,Humans,Mother-Child Relations*,Mothers,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33570212
572,LightSleepNet: A Lightweight Deep Model for Rapid Sleep Stage Classification with Spectrograms,"Deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in sleep stage classification tasks, which starts to pave the way for potential real-world applications. However, due to its enormous size, deployment of deep neural networks is hindered by high cost at various aspects, such as computation power, storage, network bandwidth, power consumption, and hardware complexity. For further practical applications (e.g., wearable sleep monitoring devices), there is a need for simple and compact models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model, namely LightSleepNet, for rapid sleep stage classification based on spectrograms. Our model is assembled by a much fewer number of model parameters compared to existing ones. Furthermore, we convert the raw EEG data into spectrograms to speed up the training process. We evaluate the model performance on several public sleep datasets with different characteristics. Experimental results show that our lightweight model using spectrogram as input can achieve comparable overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa (SHHS100: 86.7%-81.3%, Sleep-EDF: 83.7%-77.5%, Sleep-EDF-v1: 88.3%-84.5%) compared to the state-of-the-art methods on experimental datasets.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Dongdong Zhou, Qi Xu, Jian Wang, Jiacheng Zhang, Guoqiang Hu, Lauri Kettunen, Zheng Chang, Fengyu Cong",Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,2021 Nov,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Deep Learning*,Electroencephalography,Neural Networks, Computer,Sleep,Sleep Stages",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891235
573,The outcomes and experience of pregnancy in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type R9,"Introduction: Published information about the experiences of pregnancy in limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is limited and does not specify LGMD type, limiting utility. We describe the experience and outcomes of pregnancy in a cohort of women with LGMD type R9 (LGMDR. Methods: All women 18 y of age or older with a genetic and clinical diagnosis of LGMDR9 who are enrolled in the University of Iowa Wellstone dystroglycanopathy natural history study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00313677) were invited to complete a questionnaire about their pregnancy experiences, including questions about pregnancy complications, muscle symptoms experienced during pregnancy, and post-partum course. Results: A total of 22 women responded to the survey. Thirteen women reported 26 live births. The majority of pregnancies that resulted in a live birth were uncomplicated (n = 19, 73%), and most infants had no complications (n = 25, 96%). The rates of assisted vaginal delivery (n = 9, 35%) and induction of labor (n = 18, 70%) were both significantly higher than the national average. Almost half of pregnancies (n = 11, 42%) resulted in increased weakness during pregnancy; only one returned to pre-pregnancy baseline. Discussion: The data presented here suggest that women with LGMDR9 who are considering a pregnancy should be counseled that they might have a higher likelihood of assisted vaginal delivery and could experience progression of weakness. These results are generally consistent with previous reports, but future studies of pregnancy in defined subtypes of LGMD will be required to confirm these findings and determine if risks vary by genotype.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pediatrics, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. 3 Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. 4 Department of Neurology, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.","Eric M Libell , Noelle C Bowdler , Carrie M Stephan , Miriam Bridget Zimmerman , Amber M Gedlinske , Katherine D Mathews ",Muscle Nerve,2021 Jun,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Delivery, Obstetric*,Female,Health Surveys,Humans,Live Birth*,Middle Aged,Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33501999
574,Trends in childhood viable pregnancy and risk of stillbirth in the United States,"There is limited data on the trends of childhood viable pregnancy and the risk of stillbirth in the United States. Our study assessed the trends in childhood viable pregnancy and associated stillbirth rates over the previous three decades, as well as the risk of stillbirth in these highly vulnerable child mothers aged 10-14 compared with teen mothers aged 15-19. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study that used birth datasets, fetal death datasets, and the US population census data: 1982-2017. To assess the association between various sociodemographic and maternal comorbidities and stillbirth, we generated adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) from Cox proportional hazards regression models. From 1982 to 2017, viable pregnancy rates declined among children (from 0.3/1000 to 0.06/1000 population) and teens (from 40.5/1000 in 1982 to 18.1/1000). Overall, there were declines in the stillbirth rates in both teens (15-19 years old) and child mothers aged 10-14 years, but the rate remained consistently higher among child mothers vs. teen mothers (14 per 1000 vs. 8 per 1000 viable pregnancies). Compared to teen mothers, childhood pregnancy was modestly associated with an elevated risk for stillbirth (AHR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.05-1.12). Other factors significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirth included maternal race, preterm birth, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and eclampsia (P<0.0001).Conclusion: Childhood pregnancy may be a risk factor for stillbirth. This is the first study to assess the trends in childhood viable pregnancy and the associated stillbirth rates in the United States. These findings further underscore the need for sustained efforts and policies to prevent pregnancies in the early years of reproductive development. What is Known: • Childhood pregnancy, defined as pregnancy among 10-14 year-old females, may be associated with a number of pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality. • Structural disparities in socioeconomic status and access to healthcare place some teenagers at high risk of teen pregnancy. What is New: • Our study shows the trends in childhood pregnancy over the previous three decades; overall, there were declines in the stillbirth rates in both child mothers aged 10-14 years and teen (15-19 years old) mothers, but the rate remained consistently higher among child mothers. • Child mothers aged 10-14 were more likely to experience stillbirth than teenagers, and Black mothers had an increased risk of stillbirth than White mothers-all of which underscores the effects of structural health disparities.","Affiliations 1 College of Nursing & Public Health, Adelphi University, Garden City, NY, USA. 2 Department of Family Science, School of Public Health, University of Maryland College Park , 4200 Valley Drive, Suite 1142, College Park, MD, 20742, USA. 3 Center of Excellence in Health Equity, Training and Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. deepa.dongarwar@bcm.edu. 4 Office of the Provost, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. deepa.dongarwar@bcm.edu. 5 Department of Pediatrics, Texas Tech University Health Sciences, Lubbock, USA. 6 Foster School of Medicine, El-Paso, TX, USA. 7 Center of Excellence in Health Equity, Training and Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. 8 Family and Community Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.","Sahra Ibrahimi , Deepa Dongarwar , Korede K Yusuf , Sitratullah Olawunmi Maiyegun , Hamisu M Salihu ",Eur J Pediatr,2021 Aug,"Adolescent,Adult,Child,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Pregnancy in Adolescence*,Premature Birth* / epidemiology,Retrospective Studies,Stillbirth / epidemiology,United States / epidemiology,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34137918
575,Antenatal management of multiple pregnancies within the UK: A survey of practice,"Objectives: To identify variation in the antenatal management of multiple pregnancy. The UK has 10,000 twin pregnancies per year. There is established guidance on the management of dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twin pregnancy from both the RCOG and NICE, however it is likely that the provision and practice of multiple pregnancy management varies amongst units. Design: Questionnaires were posted to 151 UK maternity units in 3 rounds from May to November 2019. Results: 60 responses were received (range 11,500 to 501 deliveries), with annual multiple pregnancy rates of 190 to 4. 25 % of units did not offer a dedicated twin clinic and less than 15 % of units provided dedicated multiple pregnancy midwifery staff for intrapartum and postnatal care. Cervical length screening was performed in 24 % of units with 84 % of units offering treatment for a short cervix. 15 % of units prescribed Aspirin to all multiples, 47 % prescribing 75 mg and 43 % 150 mg. Monitoring of MC pregnancies varied with 18 % of units not measuring Middle Cerebral Artery and 29 % Ductus Venosus Dopplers. Mean caesarean section rate was 61.7 %. Delivery was offered from 37 weeks in 93 % of DC twins and from 36 weeks in 90 % MC twins. 5% of MC twins were given non labouring prophylactic antenatal steroids. Conclusion: Despite well-established national guidance for twin pregnancy management there remains a wide variation in practice among units in the provision and antenatal management of multiple pregnancies throughout the UK. The exact reasons for this variation require further exploration.","Affiliations 1 Harris-Wellbeing Research Centre, Liverpool Women's Hospital, University of Liverpool, UK. 2 Fetal Medicine Unit, Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, London, UK. 3 Fetal Medicine Unit, St George's Hospital, University of London, London, UK; Vascular Biology Research Centre, Molecular and Clinical Sciences Research Institute, St George's University of London, UK. 4 Harris-Wellbeing Research Centre, Liverpool Women's Hospital, University of Liverpool, UK.

576,Monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies,"About 1 in 5 twin pregnancies are monochorionic diamniotic. In these twins, transfusion imbalances may develop because of the vascular anastomoses that are invariably present. The most severe imbalance is twin-twin transfusion syndrome, which presents as a significant amniotic fluid difference diagnosed on ultrasound scan, usually before 26 weeks. Another transfusion imbalance is twin anemia polycythemia sequence, which is a severe hemoglobin difference occurring mainly after 26 weeks in previously uncomplicated pregnancies. Fetoscopic laser coagulation of the anastomoses addresses the cause of these transfusion imbalances. Beside transfusion imbalances, the monochorionic placenta may be unevenly divided, or one part may be dysfunctional, leading to an intertwin growth difference of more than 20%. Here, laser ablation of the anastomoses will usually not cure the problem, but it aims to protect the appropriately growing twin if the growth-restricted cotwin dies. In monochorionic twins, structural anomalies are twice as common as in singleton pregnancies, probably because of a teratogenic effect of the embryonic splitting or because of transfusion imbalances. In contrast, chromosomal anomalies seem less common, possibly because they more likely result in an early demise. Selective reduction is feasible in monochorionic pregnancies but carries increased risks of loss, miscarriage, and early birth than selective reduction in a dichorionic setting. Finally, if one monochorionic twin dies spontaneously, its cotwin may acutely exsanguinate into the demised cotwin, which may result in the loss of both twins or brain damage in the surviving twin. This update addresses the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of these common complications in monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Development and Regeneration, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

577,Insular Pharmacopoeias: Ethnobotanical Characteristics of Medicinal Plants Used on the Adriatic Islands,"The Adriatic islands in Croatia, usually divided into two archipelagos - the Kvarner and Dalmatian islands - is one of the largest groups of islands in Europe. Over 40 islands are still inhabited. Unfortunately the traditional use of medicinal plants was never properly documented there. Our data comes from 343 interviews carried out in 36 islands, including the 15 largest islands of the archipelago. The medicinal plants are mainly used to make herbal infusions or decoctions, occasionally medicinal liqueurs, syrups, compresses, or juices squeezed out of raw plants. We recorded the use of 146 taxa, among them 131 with at least one medicinal purpose and 15 only for tea. The frequency curve of use is relatively steep - several plants are used very frequently and most are reported only by one or two informants, which can be explained both by the large geographical spread of the area, and even more so by the devolution of local knowledge and disappearance of gathering practices due to specialization in tourism, modernization and depopulation. Most of the gathered plants already occur in ancient and medieval herbals and are a part of the pan-Mediterranean pharmacopoeia.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Rzeszów, Rzeszów, Poland. 2 Institute for Adriatic Crops and Karst Reclamation, Split, Croatia. 3 Institute for Marine and Coastal Research, University of Dubrovnik, Dubrovnik, Croatia. 4 Independent Researcher, Korčula, Croatia. 5 Department of Agricultural Botany, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.","Łukasz Łuczaj , Marija Jug-Dujaković , Katija Dolina , Mirjana Jeričević , Ivana Vitasović-Kosić ",Front Pharmacol,2021 May 7,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34025401
578,Herbal Medicine in the Treatment of Epilepsy,"Epilepsy is one of the most common disorders of the central nervous system. Although epilepsy is common worldwide, approximately 80% of epileptic patients live in the developing countries or those with low-middle income. Up until the second decade of the 20th century, epilepsy was treated mostly by traditional remedies. Today, antiepileptic drugs are used as a general treatment instead to prevent and control epileptic seizures. However, patient access to these drugs is hindered due to the healthcare systems of their countries and a number of other reasons, such as cultural, socio-demographic, and financial poverty. In addition, approximately 30-40%of epileptic patients suffer from refractory epilepsy, additionally, AEDs have adverse side-effects that can lead to treatment failure or reduce the patient's quality of life. Despite recent advances in the treatment of epilepsy, there is still a need for improving medical treatment with a particular focus on efficacy, safety, and accessibility. Since herbal medicines have been used for many centuries around the world for treating epilepsy, it is, therefore, plausible that a rigorous study on herbal medicine and phytochemical components within plants of various species and origin may lead to the discovery of novel AEDs. Nowadays, many medicinal plants used in different cultures and regions of the world have been identified. Most phytochemical components of these plants have been identified and, in some cases, their targets located. Therefore, it is possible that new, effective, and accessible anticonvulsants drugs can be obtained from a medicinal plant.","Affiliation 1 Department of Biology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University, Tabriz, Iran.",Simin Namvar Aghdash ,Curr Drug Targets,2021,"Review,Anticonvulsants / adverse effects,Epilepsy* / drug therapy,Humans,Phytochemicals / therapeutic use,Plant Extracts* / therapeutic use,Plants, Medicinal*,Anticonvulsants,Phytochemicals,Plant Extracts",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33023444
579,Herbal Medicine for Patients with Cognitive Impairment: An Observational Study,"Purpose: The potential effects of herbal medicine for patients with cognitive disorders have been reported in various human and animal studies. This study aimed to explore the effect of herbal medicine treatment according to the Korean Medicine (KM) pattern identification for patients with mild cognitive impairment and early dementia. Patients and methods: Twenty patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia who planned to receive herbal medicine treatment were enrolled. Herbal formulae were prescribed based on the KM pattern for 12-24 weeks. Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery II (SNSB-II) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were assessed at the baseline, after 12 weeks, and after 24 weeks (Trial registration: cris.nih.go.kr, KCT0004799). Results: Herbal medicine products, including Yukmijihwang-tang, Samhwangsasim-tang, Palmul-tang, Banhasasim-tang, and Yukgunja-tang, were prescribed to the patients. Among the SNSB-II five cognitive function domains, the T scores for language, visuospatial function, memory, and frontal/executive function increased over time. The MoCA score also improved following the treatment (mean difference 4.23 [95% CI: 2.60, 5.86], p < 0.0001 at 12-week follow-up compared to the baseline). Considering the KM pattern scores, phlegm-dampness and fire-heat scores tended to improve after the treatment. No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Conclusion: The potential effect of herbal medicine formulae products on improving cognitive functions in patients with cognitive impairment was observed. Further research is needed to objectify the KM pattern identification process and evaluate the KM pattern-related signs and symptoms.","Affiliations 1 KM Science Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. 2 R&D Strategy Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. 3 Department of Neuropsychiatry, College of Korean Medicine, Daejeon University, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. 4 KM Application Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.","Yujin Choi , Ae-Ran Kim , Ji-Yoon Lee , Hae Sook Kim , Changsop Yang , Jae Kwang Kim , Younghoon Go , In Chul Jung ",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,2021 Oct 21,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34707357
580,Changes in Sleep Duration and Timing During the Middle-to-High School Transition,"Purpose: The purpose of the study was to quantify changes in sleep during the middle-to-high school transition and determine if changes in sleep differ by sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: Adolescents were enrolled in eighth grade and followed into ninth grade (N = 110; 2,470 nights observed). The outcomes were actigraphy-estimated sleep duration, sleep onset, sleep offset, and sleep sufficiency (≥8 hours of sleep). The exposures were school grade (eighth or ninth), school night status (school or nonschool), sex (female or male), and race (white, black, or other). Results: On school nights, sleep duration declined by 25.8 minutes per night (p < .001) from eighth to ninth grade. There was no change in sleep duration on nonschool nights. Timing of sleep onset was 22.2 minutes later on school nights (p < .001) and 17.4 minutes later on nonschool nights (p < .001) in ninth grade. Timing of sleep offset did not change on school mornings but was 22.2 minutes later on nonschool mornings (p < .001) in ninth grade. The proportion of school nights (and nonschool nights) with sleep duration ≥8 hours was 9.4% (38.3%) in eighth grade and 5.7% (35.9%) in ninth grade. The odds of sleeping ≥8 hours per night was 42% lower in ninth grade, compared toeighth grade (odds ratio = .58; 95% confidence interval: .37, .91). Males were 59% less likely to sleep ≥8 hours per night. Black adolescents were 51% less likely to sleep ≥8 hours per night. Conclusions: Insufficient sleep is highly prevalent, especially on school nights and among male and black adolescents, and this problem worsens with the transition to high school.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

581,Development and validation of the Karitane Family Outcomes Tool,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop the Karitane Family Outcomes Tool (KFOT), a brief parent-report questionnaire to measure outcomes of Australian Early Parenting Centres (EPCs) and similar programmes worldwide. Design and methods: The study was conducted in two stages. In Stage One, an initial item pool (80 items) was developed via focus group discussions with clinical experts and parents. In Stage Two, three samples of parents were recruited (online community sample: n = 849, clinical sample 1: n = 141, clinical sample 2: n = 109). The online community sample completed the 80-items and then non-normally distributed items were culled, leaving a total item pool of 57 items. The online community sample was then split into two subsamples (subsample 1: n = 650, subsample 2: n = 199). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was then conducted on online community subsample 1 and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on online community subsample 2 and clinical sample 1. Using clinical sample 2, concurrent validity was assessed by examining correlations between KFOT factor scores with scores on the Parenting Stress Index. Finally, discriminant validity was assessed by examining the KFOTs sensitivity to change following EPC intervention and by comparing KFOT scores of clinical and community samples. Results: EFA revealed 13 items loading onto three factors: ""Parental feelings,"" ""Reading cues & meeting the child's needs"" and ""Perceptions of child behaviour."" The factor structure was confirmed using CFA in both the community and clinical samples. Significant differences on all three KFOT factors and on the total score were found between the clinical and community samples, suggesting that the scale is able to discriminate between clinical and nonclinical groups. Significant differences were also found between pre- and postintervention scores, and between pre- and follow-up scores, on all three KFOT factors, providing further indication of discriminant validity. The KFOT factors correlated in the expected direction with scores on the Parenting Stress Index, showing concurrent validity. Practical implications: Results indicate that the KFOT is a brief, valid and reliable parent-report scale that can be used by nurses to evaluate outcomes of EPC and similar parenting programmes.","Affiliations 1 University of New South Wales, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia. 2 Karitane, Villawood, New South Wales, Australia. 3 Population and Community Health, South Eastern Sydney Local Health District, Kogarah, New South Wales, Australia. 4 Primary and Community Health, South Western Sydney Local Health District, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia. 5 Women's and Newborn Health, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia. 6 The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.","Jane Kohlhoff , Sally Lee , Sara Cibralic , Penny Jones , Marjan Khajehei ",J Spec Pediatr Nurs,2020 Oct,"Adult,Australia,Child,Child, Preschool,Factor Analysis, Statistical,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant Behavior / psychology*,Infant, Newborn,Male,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / education*,Parents / psychology*,Program Development,Program Evaluation,Psychometrics,Reproducibility of Results,Surveys and Questionnaires / standards*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32445615
582,Maternal echocardiographic changes in twin pregnancies with and without pre-eclampsia,"Objective: Twin pregnancies are at increased risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) compared with singleton pregnancies, resulting in a substantially higher rate of maternal and perinatal complications. The strain caused by twin pregnancy on the maternal cardiovascular system has not been studied extensively. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in maternal cardiac morphology and diastolic function in a cohort of women with normotensive and those with hypertensive twin pregnancies. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary referral university center. Women with singleton or twin pregnancy were enrolled prospectively to undergo maternal transthoracic echocardiography throughout pregnancy. Multiples of the median (MoM) were calculated for each index using a reference group of uncomplicated singleton pregnancies (n = 411) in order to adjust for changes associated with gestational age. Cardiac findings were indexed for body surface area and compared among normotensive twin pregnancies, singleton pregnancies complicated by HDP and twin pregnancies complicated by HDP. Results: The total cohort included 119 HDP singleton pregnancies, 52 normotensive twin pregnancies and 24 HDP twin pregnancies. Left ventricular mass index (LVMi) MoM (median (interquartile range)) did not differ between singleton pregnancies complicated by HDP and normotensive twin pregnancies, but was significantly higher in HDP twin compared with HDP singleton pregnancies (1.31 (1.08-1.53) vs 1.17 (0.98-1.35), P = 0.032). Two diastolic indices, left atrial volume index MoM (1.12 (0.66-1.38) vs 0.65 (0.55-0.84), P = 0.003) and E/e' MoM (1.29 (1.09-1.54) vs 0.99 (0.99-1.02), P = 0.036), were significantly higher in HDP twin compared with normotensive twin pregnancies. In normotensive twin compared with HDP singleton pregnancies, stroke volume index (SVi) MoM was higher (1.20 (1.03-1.36) vs 1.00 (0.81-1.15), P = 0.004) and total vascular resistance index (TVRi) was lower (0.73 (0.70-0.86) vs 1.29 (1.04-1.56), P < 0.0001). In contrast, SVi MoM was lower (1.10 (1.02-1.35) vs 1.20 (1.03-1.36), P = 0.018) and TVRi was higher (1.00 (0.88-1.31) vs 0.73 (0.70-0.86), P = 0.029) in HDP twin compared with normotensive twin pregnancies. Conclusion: The maternal cardiovascular system is altered severely in twin pregnancy with or without HDP. Despite the low total vascular resistance, cardiac changes in normotensive twin pregnancies are comparable to those seen in singleton pregnancies complicated by HDP, reflecting the high cardiovascular demand imposed by twin pregnancy. © 2022 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Affiliations 1 Fetal Medicine Unit, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University of London, London, UK. 2 Vascular Biology Research Centre, Molecular and Clinical Sciences Research Institute, St George's University of London, London, UK. 3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Spirito Santo Tertiary Level Hospital of Pescara, Pescara, Italy. 4 Department of Cardiology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. 5 School of Psychology and Life Sciences, Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury, UK.","V Giorgione , K Melchiorre , J O'Driscoll , A Khalil , R Sharma , B Thilaganathan ",Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,2022 May,"Cross-Sectional Studies,Echocardiography,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Pre-Eclampsia* / diagnostic imaging,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000243
583,Persian Herbal Medicine in Functional Dyspepsia: A Systematic Review,"Introduction: According to Rome IV, functional dyspepsia is diagnosed with the presence of dyspepsia in the absence of organic or metabolic causes. FD caused by several factors, such as impaired gastric accommodation and hypersensitivity to gastric distention. Several studies have reported the effectiveness of herbal medicine on FD. This article, thus, reviews Persian herbal medicine in FD. Methods: Electronic databases, including Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase, Web of science and Ovid, were searched so as to find clinical articles related to dyspepsia and herbal medicine by July 2019. Our search strategies were traditional medicine, complementary and alternative medicine, herb, plant, and dyspepsia. We excluded all articles except Persian clinical trials. Results: We found 34 clinical trials with 15 herbs and 4 compound herbal remedies like Asparagus racemosus, Brassica oleracea, Cynara scolymus, Ocimum basilicum, Mentha longifolia, Mentha pulegium, Mentha piperata, Pimpinella anisum, Nigella sativa, Mastic gum, Curcuma longa, Pistatio Atlantica, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Solanum tuberosum and Zingiber officinale and compound remedies of Rosa damascene & Crocus sativus, Trachyspermum copticom & Apium graveolence, Carum carvi & Mentha pipperata, Gingiber officinalis & Cynara scolymus are effective in functional dyspepsia. Conclusion: Many people use herbal and traditional remedies for the treatment of disorders such as gastrointestinal disorders, especially in Asian countries. Several studies reported the efficacy of herbal medicine in functional dyspepsia. Although their mechanisms are not fully understood, it seems they can modulate GI motility and improve symptoms of FD.","Affiliation 1 Gastroenterology and Hepatology Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.","Maryam Azimi , Mohammad Javad Zahedi ",Curr Drug Discov Technol,2021,"Systematic Review,Drug Discovery,Dyspepsia / drug therapy*,Herbal Medicine / methods,Humans,Medicine, Persian / methods*,Phytochemicals / pharmacology*,Plants, Medicinal / classification*,Phytochemicals",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32525777
584,Nephrotoxicity of Herbal Medicine and Its Prevention,"Herbal medicine (HM) has been widely used to treat diseases for thousands of years and has greatly contributed to the health of human beings. Many new drugs have been developed from HM, such as artemisinin. However, artemisinin has adverse effects, such as renal toxicity. In 1993, a study conducted in Belgium reported for the first time that the root extracts of Aristolochia obliqua S. M. Hwang led to progressive interstitial renal fibrosis. The nephrotoxicity of HM has attracted worldwide attention. More than 100 kinds of HM induce renal toxicity, including some herbs, animal HMs, and minerals. This paper aimed to summarize the HM compounds that cause nephrotoxicity, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of these compounds, biomarkers of renal injury, and prevention strategies. These findings provide a basis for follow-up studies on the prevention and treatment of HM nephrotoxicity.","Affiliations 1 School of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China. 2 School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, China.","Xiaofen Xu , Ruyi Zhu , Jialiang Ying , Mengting Zhao , Xin Wu , Gang Cao , Kuilong Wang ",Front Pharmacol,2020 Oct 15,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33178019
585,Modulation of sleep-courtship balance by nutritional status in Drosophila,"Sleep is essential but incompatible with other behaviors, and thus sleep drive competes with other motivations. We previously showed Drosophila males balance sleep and courtship via octopaminergic neurons that act upstream of courtship-regulating P1 neurons (Machado et al., 2017). Here, we show nutrition modulates the sleep-courtship balance and identify sleep-regulatory neurons downstream of P1 neurons. Yeast-deprived males exhibited attenuated female-induced nighttime sleep loss yet normal daytime courtship, which suggests male flies consider nutritional status in deciding whether the potential benefit of pursuing female partners outweighs the cost of losing sleep. Trans-synaptic tracing and calcium imaging identified dopaminergic neurons projecting to the protocerebral bridge (DA-PB) as postsynaptic partners of P1 neurons. Activation of DA-PB neurons led to reduced sleep in normally fed but not yeast-deprived males. Additional PB-projecting neurons regulated male sleep, suggesting several groups of PB-projecting neurons act downstream of P1 neurons to mediate nutritional modulation of the sleep-courtship balance.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neuroscience, Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, United States. 2 Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal. 3 ICVS/3B's, PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga, Portugal.","José M Duhart , Victoria Baccini , Yanan Zhang , Daniel R Machado , Kyunghee Koh ",Elife,2020 Oct 21,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Video-Audio Media,Animals,Courtship*,Drosophila melanogaster / metabolism,Drosophila melanogaster / physiology*,Female,Food Deprivation / physiology,Male,Neurons / physiology,Nutritional Status / physiology*,Sleep / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33084567
586,"""Parenting Beyond the Veil"": The Continued Parenting Relationship After a Child's Death Due to Cancer","Background: Childhood cancer is the leading cause of illness-related death, leaving thousands of parents to experience bereavement. This article presents select findings about the nature of the continued parenting relationship, which is an essential theme of the parental bereavement experience. Method: Heideggerian phenomenology provided the philosophical underpinnings of this study, which aimed to describe the lived experience of bereaved parents who experienced the death of a child due to cancer. Van Manen's (1997) method guided data collection and analysis. Six parents participated in interviews to share what it has been like for them since their child's death. The researcher wrote analytic memos, documented detailed field notes, and used a member checking process to ensure trustworthiness of findings. Results: A structure of the lived experience of parental bereavement emerged, which included the essential theme of the continued parenting relationship. The parenting relationship continues throughout a parent's lifetime in spite of the child's physical absence, albeit in a different manner. This different nature of parenting is known as parenting beyond the veil. Bereaved parents continue to parent beyond the veil by engaging in meaningful activities, seeking activities that strengthen a deep connection with the child, and being open to comforting signs that enhance their continued relationship. Discussion: Parents believe sharing their experience can help nurses and other professionals understand the importance of their continued parenting relationship and their need to parent beyond the veil so that they can provide high quality care to bereaved parents in the future.","Affiliation 1 Fairfield University, Egan School of Nursing and Health Studies, 1073 North Benson Road, Fairfield, Connecticut 06824.",Christine Denhup ,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,2021 Nov-Dec,"Bereavement*,Child,Grief,Humans,Neoplasms*,Parenting,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34494927
587,"Trends in preterm birth in twin pregnancies in Victoria, Australia, 2007-2017","Background: Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. In many countries, the preterm birth rate in women with a multiple pregnancy is increasing, mostly due to an increase in iatrogenic preterm birth. Aims: To investigate trends in preterm birth in twin pregnancies in Victoria, Australia, in relation to maternal and perinatal complications. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study in all women with a twin pregnancy who delivered at or after 20 weeks of gestation in the state of Victoria, Australia between 2007 and 2017. Annual spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth rates were calculated and trends analysed. Incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal complications and risk factors for preterm birth were analysed. Results: We studied 12 757 women with a twin pregnancy. Between 2007 and 2017 the preterm birth rate increased from 641/1231 (52%) to 803/1158 (69%), mainly due to an increase in iatrogenic preterm birth from 342/1231 (28%) to 567/1158 (49%). This was irrespective of the presence of pregnancy complications. Our study showed neither a decrease in perinatal mortality from 28 weeks of gestation nor in preterm average weekly prospective stillbirth risk. Conclusion: Preterm birth rates in twins in Victoria are increasing, mainly driven by an increase in iatrogenic preterm birth. This occurred both in complicated and non-complicated twin pregnancies, and has not been accompanied by reduction in perinatal mortality from 28 weeks.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 2 Department of Obstetrics, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam Reproduction and Development Research Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria. 4 Safer Care Victoria, Melbourne, Australia.","Renée J Burger , Sofieke Temmink , Dagmar Wertaschnigg , Wessel Ganzevoort , Maya Reddy , Mary-Ann Davey , Euan Morrison Wallace , Ben-Willem Mol ",Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol,2021 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Twin Study,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Pregnancy, Twin*,Premature Birth* / epidemiology,Retrospective Studies,Victoria / epidemiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32820556

591,Nutritional status in older people - An explorative analysis,"Background & aims: The nutritional status is seldom defined in general, but is considered to be important throughout life span, especially in times of diseases and disabilities. We previously proposed a theoretical model of the nutritional status from a functional perspective [1], however without proposing a definition of the nutritional status. The model comprises four domains that might affect the nutritional and functional status in a bidirectional way. These four domains are: Food and nutrition; Health and somatic disorders; Physical function and capacity; and Cognitive, affective, and sensory function. This study contributes to the existing literature and knowledge by empirically analysing patterns and relationships of possible nutritional status indicators within and between the four domains. Methods: This study is based on a sample of 69 men and women; older than 65 years, receiving home health care. They were followed up for three years. A broad set of nutritional status indicators in the participants were assessed in their home yearly. Given the small sample size and large number of variables, we used both correlation and factor analysis to explore patterns of nutritional status indicators within the four domains and relationships between the four domains suggested by the theoretical model of nutritional status which we proposed earlier. Results: At baseline, between 4 and 18 components were extracted from the four domains, separately, using factor analysis. The first three components of each domain (called main components) were correlated (p < 0.05) with at least one of the main components of each of the other three domains (r = -0.34-0.79 at baseline, 0.38-0.74 at year 1, 0.40-0.77 at year 2 and 0.47-0.71 at year 3). At baseline, these main components explained, respectively, 31%, 52%, 57% and 63% of the sample variation in the four domains. This remained stable throughout all three years of follow up. In all four domains, there were statistically significant differences in prevalence of malnutrition, frailty, sarcopenia, and dehydration (all different inadequate nutritional status) between individuals' individual component scores. Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence for the relationship between nutritional status indicators within and between the four domains suggested by our theoretical model of nutritional status. Components in all four domains were associated with inadequate nutritional status, highlighting that a wide perspective of the nutritional status assessment is necessary to be applied in clinical practice.","Affiliations 1 School of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.

595,Models for predicting sleep latency and sleep duration,"Study objectives: Planning effective sleep-wake schedules for civilian and military settings depends on the ability to predict the extent to which restorative sleep is likely for a specified sleep period. Here, we developed and validated two mathematical models, one for predicting sleep latency and a second for predicting sleep duration, as decision aids to predict efficacious sleep periods. Methods: We extended the Unified Model of Performance (UMP), a well-validated mathematical model of neurobehavioral performance, to predict sleep latency and sleep duration, which vary nonlinearly as a function of the homeostatic sleep pressure and the circadian rhythm. To this end, we used the UMP to predict the time course of neurobehavioral performance under different conditions. We developed and validated the models using experimental data from 317 unique subjects from 24 different studies, which included sleep conditions spanning the entire circadian cycle. Results: The sleep-latency and sleep-duration models accounted for 42% and 84% of the variance in the data, respectively, and yielded acceptable average prediction errors for planning sleep schedules (4.0 min for sleep latency and 0.8 h for sleep duration). Importantly, we identified conditions under which small shifts in sleep onset timing result in disproportionately large differences in sleep duration-knowledge that may be applied to improve performance, safety, and sustainability in civilian and military operations. Conclusions: These models extend the capabilities of existing predictive fatigue-management tools, allowing users to anticipate the most opportune times to schedule sleep periods.","Affiliations 1 Department of Defense Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute, Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, Fort Detrick, MD. 2 The Henry M.

596,Assessment of Phytochemicals and Herbal Formula for the Treatment of Depression through Metabolomics,"Depression is a widespread and persistent psychiatric disease. Due to various side effects and no curative treatments of conventional antidepressant drugs, botanical medicines have attracted considerable attention as a complementary and alternative approach. The pathogenesis of depression is quite complicated and unclear. Metabolomics is a promising new technique for the discovery of novel biomarkers for exploring the potential mechanisms of diverse diseases and assessing the therapeutic effects of drugs. In this article, we systematically reviewed the study of botanical medicine for the treatment of depression using metabolomics over a period from 2010 to 2019. Additionally, we summarized the potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways associated with herbal medicine treatment for depression. Through a comprehensive evaluation of herbal medicine as novel antidepressants and understanding of their pharmacomechanisms, a new perspective on expanding the application of botanical medicines for the treatment of depression is provided.","Affiliations 1 State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Food Science and Engineering, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin 300457, China. 2 School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA 92103, United States.","Xu Wang , Guanyu Lu , Xuan Liu , Jinhui Li , Fei Zhao , Kefeng Li ",Curr Pharm Des,2021,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Systematic Review,Depression / drug therapy,Drugs, Chinese Herbal*,Herbal Medicine,Humans,Metabolomics,Phytochemicals / pharmacology,Plants, Medicinal*,Drugs, Chinese Herbal,Phytochemicals",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33001005
597,Twin pregnancy in women with epilepsy,"Objective: We report data from the Raoul Wallenberg Australian Register of Antiepileptic Drugs in Pregnancy (APR) to see if there are significant differences in relation to the courses and outcomes of the twin pregnancies contained in the register, as compared with the singleton ones. Methods: The APR has been under the oversight of Melbourne institutional Human Ethics Research Committees; all women enrolled in the APR have provided written informed consent. Data from the APR were transferred to a spreadsheet and then analyzed using simple statistical techniques including logistic regression. Results: The population studied comprised 44 twin and 2261 singleton pregnancies; thus, twin pregnancies accounted for 1.91% of all pregnancies studied. The women carrying twins tended to be older than the women with singleton pregnancies to a statistically significant extent, their pregnancies more often originated from assisted fertilization techniques, and their babies were more often delivered by cesarean section. There were no statistically significant differences in relation to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Individual twins had statistically significantly lower mean birthweights than singleton babies and they were statistically significantly more often involved structurally malformed foetuses. In the first year of life, the twin pregnancies statistically significantly more often produced offspring that were affected by seizures in infancy. Significance: The data suggest that there may be an increased hazard of fetal malformation in the offspring of twin pregnancy in women with epilepsy, but that with contemporary standards of management of epilepsy and pregnancy, there is unlikely to be an increased hazard of seizure-affected pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine and Neurosciences, Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne, Parkville, Vic, Australia. 2 Department of Neurology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Vic, Australia. 3 Department of Neuroscience, Monash University, Clayton, Vic, Australia. 4 Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and School of Medicine and Biomedical Science, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.","Frank J E Vajda , Terence J O'Brien , Janet E Graham , Alison A Hitchcock , Piero Perucca , Cecilie M Lander , Mervyn J Eadie ",Epilepsia,2020 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Australia / epidemiology,Case-Control Studies,Cesarean Section / statistics & numerical data,Congenital Abnormalities / epidemiology,Epilepsy / complications*,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / pathology*,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, Twin* / statistics & numerical data,Registries",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33140408
598,Nano Phytomedicine Based Delivery System for CNS Disease,"Herbal medicines are being used since ancient times and are an important part of the alternative and traditional medicinal system. In recent decades, scientists are embracing herbal medicines based on the fact that a number of drugs that are currently in use are derived directly or indirectly from plant sources. Moreover, herbal drugs have lesser side effects, albeit are potentially strong therapeutic agents. The herbal medicine market is estimated to be around US $62 billion globally. Herbal medicine has gained widespread acceptance due to its low toxicity, low cost, ease of accessibility and efficacy in treating difficult diseases. Safety and efficacy are another important factors in the commercialization process of herbal medicines. Nanotechnology has been shown to be potentially effective in improving the bioactivity and bioavailability of herbal medicines. Development of nano-phytomedicines (or by reducing the size of phytomedicine), attaching polymers with phytomedicines and modifying the surface properties of herbal drugs, have increased the solubility, permeability and eventually the bioavailability of herbal formulations. Novel formulations such as niosomes, liposomes, nanospheres, phytosomes etc., can be exploited in this area. This article reviews herbal medicines, which have prominent activity in the Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders and reported nano-phytomedicines based delivery systems.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmaceutics, Nibha Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Rajgir, Nalanda-803116, Bihar, India. 2 Department of Pharmaceutics, Anurag Group of Institutions, School of Pharmacy, Venkatapur, Ghatkesar, Telangana-500088, India. 3 Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Education & Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi-110062, India. 4 College of Basic Health Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia. 5 Faculty of Pharmacy, Maulana Azad University, Jodhpur 342802, Rajasthan, India. 6 Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Jouf University, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia. 7 Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia. 8 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara-144411, Punjab, India. 9 Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Hafr Al Batin, Al Jamiah, Hafr Al Batin- 39524, Saudi Arabia.","Mohammed Asadullah Jahangir , Chettupalli Anand , Abdul Muheem , Sadaf Jamal Gilani , Mohamad Taleuzzaman , Ameeduzzafar Zafar , Mohammed Jafar , Surajpal Verma , Md Abul Barkat ",Curr Drug Metab,2020,"Review,Animals,Central Nervous System Diseases / drug therapy*,Drug Delivery Systems*,Humans,Nanomedicine,Phytotherapy*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32445453
599,Dietary microRNAs: Current status and perspective in food science,"Food safety and health conditions are global issues that are primarily caused by insufficient nutrition or contaminated food, which have enormous social, economic, and public health implications. Foodomics study mainly involves nutrigenomics, nutrigenetics, and nutritional epigenetics, which help in finding the correlation between genetic variation and nutrient-driven epigenetic alterations that are suggested as a primary challenge to nutritional needs. Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that have recently gained in popularity as a result of their critical roles in gene regulation and nutritional studies. In this commentary, the relevance of miRNAs to human nutrition is discussed. This study emphasizes the importance of dietary miRNAs based on numerous independent studies, which have explained the unique characteristics of dietary miRNAs in terms of gene expression regulation mechanism. There is an urgent requirement of measurement techniques to detect miRNA in food and evolutionary samples. These techniques may be helpful to find even low levels of miRNAs because of their high susceptibility and selectivity. There is a desperate requisite to evaluate the impact of dietary supplement compounds on circulating and tissue miRNAs. Food science studies in humans may aid in the identification of novel biomarkers and other necessary mode of action of certain dietary compounds, with the goal of facilitating how nutrients and bioactive components can influence miRNAs and enforce biological effects. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Dietary microRNAs may be helpful to find even the low levels of miRNAs due to their high susceptibility and selectivity. There is also desperate need to evaluate the impact of dietary supplement compounds effect on circulating and tissue miRNAs. There is also requirement for new analytical tools to study the role of gene regulations and nutrition in different diseases. The quality of dietary miRNAs should be investigated, particularly the exogenous types which are used as high doses in food supplements. It would also be of great interest to use antagomir technology in food science research, in addition to omics technology. Dietary miRNAs may also aid in the identification of novel biomarkers. These are some of the practical applications of dietary miRNAs.","Affiliation 1 Dental Research Cell and Biomedical Research Unit, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, India.","K Auxzilia Preethi , Durairaj Sekar ",J Food Biochem,2021 Jul,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Diet,Food Technology,Humans,MicroRNAs* / genetics,Nutrigenomics,Nutritional Status,MicroRNAs",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34132408
600,Colloidal and vesicular delivery system for herbal bioactive constituents,"Objectives: The main objective of the present review is to explore and examine the effectiveness of currently developed novel techniques to resolve the issues which are associated with the herbal constituents/extract. Methods: A systematic thorough search and collection of reviewed information from Science direct, PubMed and Google Scholar databases based on various sets of key phrases have been performed. All the findings from these data have been studied and briefed based on their relevant and irrelevant information. Result: Herbal drugs are gaining more popularity in the modern world due to their applications in curing various ailments with minimum toxic effects, side effect or adverse effect. However, various challenges exist with herbal extracts/plant actives such as poor solubility (water/lipid), poor permeation, lack of targeting specificity, instability in highly acidic pH, and liver metabolism, etc. Nowadays with the expansion in the technology, novel drug delivery system provides avenues and newer opportunity towards the delivery of herbal drugs with improved physical chemical properties, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic. Developing nano-strategies like Polymeric nanoparticles, Liposomes, Niosomes, Microspheres, Phytosomes, Nanoemulsion and Self Nano Emulsifying Drug Delivery System, etc. imparts benefits for delivery of phyto formulation and herbal bioactives. Nano formulation of phytoconstituents/ herbal extract could lead to enhancement of aqueous solubility, dissolution, bioavailability, stability, reduce toxicity, permeation, sustained delivery, protection from enzymatic degradation, etc. CONCLUSION: Based on the above findings, the conclusion can be drawn that the nano sized novel drug delivery systems of herbal and herbal bioactives have a potential future for upgrading the pharmacological action and defeating or overcoming the issues related with these constituents. The aims of the present review was to summarize and critically analyze the recent development of nano sized strategies for promising phytochemicals delivery systems along with their therapeutic applications supported by experimental evidence and discussing the opportunities for further aspects.","Affiliations 1 Columbia Institute of Pharmacy Raipur, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India. ravindraiop@gmail.com. 2 Columbia Institute of Pharmacy Raipur, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India.","Ravindra Pandey , Monika Bhairam , Shiv Shankar Shukla , Bina Gidwani ",Daru,2021 Dec,"Review,Biological Availability,Drug Delivery Systems / methods*,Herbal Medicine,Humans,Hydrogen-Ion Concentration,Liver / metabolism*,Phytochemicals / chemistry*,Phytochemicals / pharmacokinetics,Phytochemicals",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34327650
601,A psychological support group for parents in the care of families with gender diverse children and adolescents,"Parenting gender diverse children and adolescents can be a challenging experience, entailing doubts about how to protect and support them during their development. Parental reactions impact on the child's sense of security and well-being. Therefore, when caring for families with gender diverse children, it is important to offer support to parents. In this article we present an experience with a 12-month support group for parents of young people who attended the service for gender identity development at a paediatric hospital. We describe the group structure and methodology, together with the process for evaluating the intervention. At 6-month intervals, parents were asked to indicate the most important topics that had emerged during the monthly sessions. At 12 months, they completed a semi-structured feedback questionnaire about their experience in the group, including possible difficulties encountered. Thematic analysis showed an evolution in time, with participants taking a more complex perspective on gender diversity and the needs of their children, while feeling more able to deal with the uncertainties related to gender identity development. After attending the group, parents reported feeling less lonely, more confident, and better able to communicate with their children. They related these positive changes to the opportunity of sharing experiences and mutual learning. This feed-back provides preliminary evidence that the psychological support group was perceived to be a useful resource by parents of gender diverse young people.","Affiliations 1 Division of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry, Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy. 2 Gender Identity Development Service, The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. 3 Regina Margherita Pediatric Hospital, Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry, Torino, Italy.","Angela M Caldarera , Sarah Davidson , Benedetto Vitiello , Chiara Baietto ",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,2021 Jan,"Adolescent,Child,Female,Gender Identity*,Humans,Male,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting,Parents*,Self-Help Groups",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070619
602,Effect of Music Therapy on Sleep Quality,"Context: One of the important functions of nurses is to prepare a relaxing environment for patients, for whom they look after and fulfill sleep needs. Today, music therapy, one of nonpharmacological treatment approaches, can be used for enhancing the sleep quality of individuals. The increase of individuals' sleep quality by using music therapy will enable nurses to intervene in problems associated with sleep disorders and prevent insomnia and other relevant problems. Objective: This study was conducted to determine the effect of music therapy on sleep quality of the students. Design: The research was an experimental pretest-posttest control group design. Setting: The research was conducted among the students studying in the nursing department at a university in the east of Turkey in the spring term of the academic year of 2015-2016. Participant: Students who (1) got a total score of 5 and higher according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), (2) had no neurological/psychiatric disorder, (3) had no hearing problem, (4) received no medical treatment regarding sleep, and (5) volunteered to participate in the study were included in the study. The students who were included in the study were divided into experimental and control groups. Invention: Students in the experimental group were instructed to keep the volume of the personal MP3 player to be used for listening to the music therapy below 70% and to use it for 1 h/d at most. No intervention was applied to students in the control group. They were asked to sustain their normal sleeping habits. Outcome measure: To collect the data, a questionnaire prepared by the researchers for determining sociodemographic characteristics of the students and PSQI were used. Results: As a result of the study, it was found that the posttest PSQI mean scores of students in the experimental group, listening to music therapy, were lower than the mean scores of the students in the control group, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant. Conclusions: As a result of this study, it was determined that music therapy increased the sleep quality of students. Being one of the nonpharmacological treatment approaches intended for solving sleep problems, music therapy is a pain-free, safe, and affordable treatment method without any side effect that could be used in every area of health.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Mehtap Kavurmaci, Nuray Dayapoğlu, Mehtap Tan",Altern Ther Health Med,2020 Jul,"Adult,Female,Humans,Male,Music Therapy / methods*,Music*,Sleep / physiology,Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders / therapy*,Sleep Wake Disorders / therapy*,Students / psychology*,Turkey,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31221932

607,Parental Involvement - Perceptions of Parents and their Adolescent Children,"Objective: To explore the experiences of parents and their adolescent children, specifically the dimension of parental involvement in the lives of their adolescent children and how adolescents perceived it. Methods: Following informed consent, a total of nine families with 22 participants took part in the study including nine adolescents, aged between 14 and 16 y, and 13 parents. One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted at their homes following informed consent. Following transcription, the data was coded and themes were identified using Atlas.ti software. A grounded theory approach was undertaken in analysing the data. Results: Two main themes were identified including perceptions of parental involvement in the lives of their adolescent children and family strategies to improve bonding. Adolescents' concerns centered on reduced interaction time with their family members. Concerns were also raised over the adolescents' increasing academic burden and parents particularly emphasized the increasing use of media and mobile technology by adolescents as deterrents to interaction. Though mothers functioned as primary caregivers, fathers also took on more active roles in the rearing of their children, stepping away from the traditionally viewed role of being a distant patriarchal provider. To improve interaction, parents devised creative strategies to increase time spent interacting with family members such as having dinner, performing household chores, playing games, or visiting places together. Conclusions: The increasing academic burden and access to digital media were perceived as factors leading to reduced interaction between the parent-adolescent dyad. Creative parenting strategies to increase interaction were sought as a solution.","Affiliations 1 Department of Community Medicine, Melaka Manipal Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India. 2 MSW Program, Prasanna School of Public Health (PSPH), Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India. lena.ashok@manipal.edu. 3 Department of Community Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India. 4 Department of Data Science, Prasanna School of Public Health (PSPH), Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India. 5 Department of Pediatrics, Melaka Manipal Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India. 6 Department of Psychiatry, Dr. AV Baliga Memorial Hospital, Udupi, India.","Varalakshmi Chandra Sekaran , Lena Ashok , Veena Ganesh Kamath , Asha Kamath , Asha P Hegde , Virupaksha Devaramane ",Indian J Pediatr,2020 Mar,"Adolescent,Adolescent Behavior,Adult,Fathers / psychology,Female,Humans,India,Internet,Male,Middle Aged,Mothers / psychology,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents,Perception*,Psychology, Adolescent*,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31925719

We aimed to address adult perceptions of a healthy pregnancy and explored their needs and concerns about childbirth across the lifespan. We conducted a qualitative study using content analysis to investigate general perceptions of a healthy pregnancy after focus-group interviews with adult men and women. We interviewed 60 participants in nine group sessions of 5 to 8 people per group. Three major themes emerged that affect healthy pregnancies: Taking responsibility for a prepared pregnancy, factors that interfere with a healthy pregnancy, and improving strategies for a healthy pregnancy. For the first theme, the two main concerns were financial and parenthood preparation. Factors interfering with a healthy pregnancy had direct and indirect causes, considering personal, social, and cultural changes. Strategies for a healthy pregnancy included family and workplace support, systematic education, and governmental support for financial preparation and health screening. Participants averred that various kinds of support (financial, healthcare, and career) are needed for a healthy pregnancy and childbirth. This public awareness could promote better decisions toward healthy pregnancy with more sociocultural approaches in the various settings of home, school, and the workplace.","Affiliations 1 Seoul National University, College of Nursing, Research Institute of Nursing Science, Seoul 03080, Korea. 2 College of Nursing, Woosuk University, Jeollabuk-do 55338, Korea. 3 College of Nursing, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 06591, Korea. 4 College of Nursing, Seoul National University, Seoul 03080, Korea. 5 College of Nursing, Eulji University, Daejeon 34824, Korea.","Hae Won Kim , Duck Hee Kim , Hyang Yuol Lee , Young Jin Lee , Hye Young Ahn ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020 Apr 3,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Child,Delivery, Obstetric*,Female,Focus Groups,Health Status*,Humans,Male,Parturition*,Pregnancy,Qualitative Research",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32260300
609,Discrepancies in Parent Perceptions of Child Vulnerability in Youth With Spina Bifida,"Objective: This study aimed to describe informant discrepancies between mother and father reports of child vulnerability in youth with spina bifida (SB) and examine variables that were associated with these discrepancies. Methods: Ninety-two parent dyads, with a child with SB (ages 8-15 years), were recruited as a part of a longitudinal study. Mothers and fathers completed questionnaires assessing parental perception of child vulnerability (PPCV), as well as medical and demographic information, behavioral aspects of the couple relationship, parenting stress, mental health of the parent, and child behavioral adjustment. The degree to which there was a parenting alliance was assessed with observational data. Mother-father discrepancies were calculated at the item level. Results: Findings revealed that greater father mental health symptoms, parenting stress, and child behavior problems were associated with ""father high and mother low"" discrepancies in PPCV. There were also lower scores on observed parenting alliance when there were higher rates of ""father high and mother low"" discrepancies in PPCV. Conclusions: For families of youth with SB, discrepancies in PPCV where fathers perceive high vulnerability and mothers perceive low vulnerability may be a ""red flag"" for the presence of other parental and child adjustment difficulties. Findings are discussed in terms of the Attribution Bias Context Model and underscore the importance of including fathers in research on families who have children with chronic health conditions.","Affiliation 1 Psychology Department, Loyola University Chicago.","Tessa K Kritikos , Colleen F Bechtel Driscoll , Grayson N Holmbeck ",J Pediatr Psychol,2021 Apr 16,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Child,Fathers,Female,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Mothers,Parenting*,Parents,Perception,Spinal Dysraphism*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33355337
610,Mesenteric Phlebosclerosis Associated with Herbal Medicine,"Mesenteric phlebosclerosis (MP) associated with herbal medicine is rarely reported and its endoscopic and radiological features remain poorly described. An 81-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for right lower abdominal pain and high-grade fever. Computed tomography (CT) revealed wall thickening, pericolic fat stranding, and linear calcifications extending from the cecum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. Ultrasonography (US) revealed wall thickening of the cecum and ascending colon. Colonoscopy (CS) revealed dark-purple edematous mucosa with erosion and ulcers from the cecum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. The patient was histopathologically diagnosed with MP, discontinued orengedokuto, and was treated with intravenous antibiotics for 1 week. Six months after treatment, US and CT revealed no significant changes, but CS showed improvement in dark-purple edematous mucosa with erosion and ulcers. To our knowledge, this report represents a valuable addition to the MP literature describing a rare case of MP associated with herbal medicine.","Affiliations 1 Department of Gastroenterology, National Hospital Organization Hakodate National Hospital, Hakodate, Japan. 2 Department of Pathology, National Hospital Organization Hakodate National Hospital, Hakodate, Japan.","Kimitoshi Kubo , Noriko Kimura , Norishige Maiya , Soichiro Matsuda , Momoko Tsuda , Mototsugu Kato ",Case Rep Gastroenterol,2020 Oct 27,Case Reports,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33250691
611,The Anticancer Efficiency of Citrullus colocynthis Toward the Colorectal Cancer Therapy,"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of death worldwide. Chemotherapy is associated with some side effects during CRC treatment. Hence, proper employment of lower toxic and approaches exerting lowest side effects are essential. The Citrullus colocynthis (C. colocynthis) seems a potential anticancerous herbal medicine (HM) against CRC mostly via various efficient compounds. Methods: We performed a literature review regarding the anticancer traits of C. colocynthis against CRC. The possible active compounds, mechanisms, and combination therapies in vitro and in vivo or clinical trials have been also stated where found. Results and conclusion: The anticancerous effects of C. colocynthis has been via a variety of pathways including apoptotic pathways (increase in caspase-3 and inhibiting STAT3 function), antioxidant and anti-inflammatory (TNF-α, nitric oxide, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1α) traits, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and antiangiogenesis and antimetastatic effects. Future studies will be promising regarding proper application of C. colocynthis compounds following their extraction.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy/Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad, Iraq. 2 Department of Biology, College of Sci for Women, University of Babylon, Hillah, Iraq. 3 Department of Biology, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran. majidghasemian86@gmail.com.","Manal Khalid Abdulridha , Ali-H Al-Marzoqi , Abdolmajid Ghasemian ",J Gastrointest Cancer,2020 Jun,"Review,Adult,Aged,Citrullus colocynthis / chemistry*,Colorectal Neoplasms / drug therapy*,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Middle Aged,Plant Extracts / pharmacology,Plant Extracts / therapeutic use*,Plant Extracts",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31463888

However, a comprehensive list for the interdisciplinary field of sleep research does not currently exist because our journals tend to be placed into discipline-specific lists that do not cope well with our historic interdisciplinarity, which embraces many core disciplines. We aimed to build a ranking list specifically for sleep research journals based on the journal impact factor and the google scholar H5 indices. We then searched for all sleep journals given an impact factor by Thomson Reuters from 2005 to 2018 and all journals given a current H5 index by Google Scholar. We provide a ranking list specifically for sleep journals that might be useful for researchers to cite when providing context in their applications for employment, promotion and funding.","Affiliations 1 CIRUS, Centre for Sleep and Chronobiology, Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. 2 Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. 3 School of Psychology, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","Nathaniel S Marshall , Camilla M Hoyos ",J Sleep Res,2020 Oct,"Historical Article,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,History, 21st Century,Humans,Journal Impact Factor*,Sleep / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32233003
613,The inescapable drive to sleep: Overlapping mechanisms of sleep and sedation,"Common human experience is that a long period without sleep is unsustainable, and it is also detrimental to health and behavior. The powerful and primal urge to sleep after sleep deprivation is intense and seems inescapable. The longer we stay awake, the more we feel the need to sleep, and however much we resist, we will inevitably succumb. Although it is obvious what benefits derive from other common and strong physiological drives, such as hunger, sex, and thirst, it is less obvious what drives us to sleep and what benefits accrue. Understanding the biochemical or circuit basis for the sleep drive could enable the benefits of sleep to be artificially stimulated with a new generation of sedative drugs.","Affiliation 1 Department of Life Sciences and UK Dementia Research Institute, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.","Nicholas P Franks , William Wisden ",Science,2021 Oct 29,"Review,Animals,Body Temperature,Brain / physiology*,Conscious Sedation,Homeostasis,Humans,Hypnotics and Sedatives / pharmacology*,Sleep Stages,Sleep* / physiology,Hypnotics and Sedatives",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34709918
614,[Parental factors in internet and computer game addiction in adolescence: An overview],"Parental factors in internet and computer game addiction in adolescence: An overview Abstract. Objective: Internet-related disorders (IRD) in adolescents and young adults are closely linked to family factors. However, few research and review articles include the family. To this end, N = 87 scientific papers were integrated into the literature review. Method: The present work gives an overview of parental factors that can be involved in the development, maintenance, and reduction of symptoms. Results: The literature provides clear connections between the parent-child relationship and IRD in adolescents and young adults. The quality of parent-child communication appears to be a promising approach for influencing IRD symptoms. There are indications that, at least for some families, encouraging the time spent together could be helpful. Regarding educational aspects, a distinction should be made between different areas. Parental knowledge and control of internet use seem to be protective factors. The effect of rules and restrictions, however, is unclear. Conclusions: To change IRD symptoms, it makes sense to improve the parent-child relationship. However, the ways to achieve that have hardly been explored. Recommendations regarding parenting strategies (e. g., rules and restrictions) should be formulated very carefully, as the effects are still unclear. The integration of parents in prevention and intervention efforts is advocated by many researchers, but there only individual studies have considered parents in the context of interventions.","Affiliation 1 Abteilung Psychiatrie, Psychosomatik und Psychotherapie im Kindes- und Jugendalter, Klinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Universitätsklinikum Tübingen.","Isabel Brandhorst , Tobias Renner , Gottfried Maria Barth ",Z Kinder Jugendpsychiatr Psychother,2021 Jan,"Review,Adolescent,Humans,Internet,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting,Parents*,Video Games*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34238056

617,Placental Regulation of Energy Homeostasis During Human Pregnancy,"Successful pregnancies rely on sufficient energy and nutrient supply, which require the mother to metabolically adapt to support fetal needs. The placenta has a critical role in this process, as this specialized organ produces hormones and peptides that regulate fetal and maternal metabolism. The ability for the mother to metabolically adapt to support the fetus depends on maternal prepregnancy health. Two-thirds of pregnancies in the United States involve obese or overweight women at the time of conception. This poses significant risks for the infant and mother by disrupting metabolic changes that would normally occur during pregnancy. Despite well characterized functions of placental hormones, there is scarce knowledge surrounding placental endocrine regulation of maternal metabolic trends in pathological pregnancies. In this review, we discuss current efforts to close this gap of knowledge and highlight areas where more research is needed. As the intrauterine environment predetermines the health and wellbeing of the offspring in later life, adequate metabolic control is essential for a successful pregnancy outcome. Understanding how placental hormones contribute to aberrant metabolic adaptations in pathological pregnancies may unveil disease mechanisms and provide methods for better identification and treatment. Studies discussed in this review were identified through PubMed searches between the years of 1966 to the present. We investigated studies of normal pregnancy and metabolic disorders in pregnancy that focused on energy requirements during pregnancy, endocrine regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, and placental hormone regulation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, Michigan. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.","Brooke Armistead , Eugenia Johnson , Robert VanderKamp , Elzbieta Kula-Eversole , Leena Kadam , Sascha Drewlo , Hamid-Reza Kohan-Ghadr ",Endocrinology,2020 Jul 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Adaptation, Physiological*,Diabetes, Gestational / metabolism,Energy Metabolism*,Female,Hormones / metabolism*,Humans,Placenta / metabolism*,Pregnancy / metabolism*,Hormones",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32417921

Methods: Relevant studies were searched in multiple databases. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was used as the effect indicator for measurement data, and each effect size was given estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Nine studies with 647 patients were selected. Compared with the results in the control group, pain intensity was significantly relieved in the trial group when assessed by the intervention (cinnamon vs. placebo: WMD = 1.815, 95% CI = 1.330-2.301; fennel vs. placebo: WMD = 0.528, 95% CI = 0.119-6.829; ginger vs. placebo: WMD = 2.902, 95% CI = 2.039-3.765), observation period (one cycle: WMD = 2.061, 95% CI = 0.815-3.307; one cycles: WMD = 1.831, 95% CI = 0.973-2.690), and study quality (high quality: WMD = 2.224, 95% CI = 1.488-2.960). Pain duration was significantly shorter in the trial group (cinnamon vs. placebo: WMD = 16.200, 95% CI = 15.271-17.129). No publication bias was observed for either outcome. Conclusions: For primary dysmenorrhea, cinnamon/fennel/ginger effectively reduced pain intensity, and cinnamon shortened the duration of pain. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.","Affiliations 1 College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, P.R.

A convenience sample of 658 parents residing in New Zealand completed an online questionnaire. Participants responded to questions probing parent and child characteristics, child ASD severity (the Autism Impact Measure: AIM), parenting stress (the Autism Parenting Stress Index: APSI), and parent mental health (the General Health Questionnaire: GHQ-28). The results indicated that the majority of the parents in our sample have reached clinical levels of psychiatric distress, in particular anxiety. Parent and child characteristics were poor predictors of parental mental health problems. Parenting stress, however, was found to be a significant predictor, also acting as a mediator variable between child ASD symptom severity and parental mental health problems. Our findings are interpreted in relation to their significance to clinical practice.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.

620,Sleep quality: An evolutionary concept analysis,"Aim: To clarify the meaning of the concept sleep quality. Background: Sleep loss and sleep quality are global health concerns. Poor sleep quality has significant adverse health outcomes. A clarification of the term is necessary to inform patients and healthcare providers, promote consistent theoretical and operational definitions in research, and develop prevention and treatment strategies. Design: Concept analysis. Data sources: Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMED, Web of Science, and JSTOR) and definitions from online dictionaries. Review methods: Rodgers' Evolutionary method was applied to guide the concept analysis to identify and determine the attributes, antecedents, and consequences. Results: Sleep quality is defined as an individual's self-satisfaction with all aspects of the sleep experience. Sleep quality has four attributes: sleep efficiency, sleep latency, sleep duration, and wake after sleep onset. Antecedents include physiological (e.g., age, circadian rhythm, body mass index, NREM, REM), psychological (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression), and environmental factors (e.g., room temperature, television/device use), and family/social commitments. Good sleep quality has positive effects such as feeling rested, normal reflexes, and positive relationships. Poor sleep quality consequences include fatigue, irritability, daytime dysfunction, slowed responses, and increased caffeine/alcohol intake. Conclusions: Sleep quality is essential, and poor sleep quality contributes to disease and poor health outcomes. Given the extensive consequences of poor sleep quality, nurses and clinicians are vital in instructing the importance of good sleep.","Affiliation 1 College of Nursing, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.","Kathy L Nelson , Jean E Davis , Cynthia F Corbett ",Nurs Forum,2022 Jan,"Anxiety,Anxiety Disorders,Concept Formation,Health Personnel,Humans,Sleep Quality*,Sleep*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34610163
621,Rheumatological therapy in Prehispanic Mesoamerica,"Nahuatl medicine was remarkably advanced in Prehispanic Mesoamerica. Thoughts on health and disease were different to those prevalent in Europe in the sixteenth century because they included magic, religion and different kinds of animal, mineral and, notably, herbal medicine. These resources were used in a supplementary, not isolated, way by Nahua physicians (ticitl) according to patients' needs and beliefs. Most Nahua physicians had similar knowledge but there were some differences between rural and urban areas, and those who were also doctor-priests of a particular deity. After the European colonization of Mesoamerica, great efforts were made by Spaniards and Indians to recover the immense amount of ancient knowledge in Mesoamerica related to medicine. Some of this work, not all, is included in the Cruz-Badiano Codex, the Florentine Codex or Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva España, and the Francisco Hernández Codex. A review of these codices and the recent literature on the practice of Nahua Medicine was performed with particular interest in herbal medicine in rheumatic diseases, or symptoms probably related to rheumatic diseases, during the sixteenth century in the land currently known as Mexico.","Affiliation 1 Colegio Mexicano de Reumatología, Naucalpan de Juárez, Estado de México, Mexico.

Herbal medicines are commonly used by HIV/AIDs clients. There is limited data on the prevalence of herbal medicine and correlating factors of herbal medicine use in Malawi. This study establishes prevalence and factors contributing to the use of herbal medicine among HIV/AIDS clients attending the ART clinic at QECH, Blantyre Malawi. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to interview 211 conveniently sampled clients at QECH ART clinic. The questionnaire addressed socio-demographic, clinical characteristics, NCD-HIV comorbidity, and herbal medicine utilization. The main outcome of the study was herbal medicine use since the initiation of ART. Logistic regression analysis was done in Stata version 16. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were fitted for potential confounders. Results: The prevalence of use of herbal medicine was reported in 17.5% (n=37) of the ART clients. The adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that urban residence was statistically associated with reduced use of herbal medicine (adjusted Odds Ratio - AOR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.169, 0.976). Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of use of herbal medicine among clients taking ART. Herbal Medicine has the potential to cover the gaps in health coverage in rural communities.","Affiliations 1 Department of Health Systems and Policy, School of Public Health and Family Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Malawi/Kamuzu University of Health Sciences. 2 Department of Public Health, School of Public Health and Family Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Malawi/Kamuzu University of Health Sciences.","Hawah Mbali , Jessie Jane Khaki Sithole , Alinane Linda Nyondo-Mipando ",Malawi Med J,2021 Sep,"Cross-Sectional Studies,HIV Infections* / drug therapy,HIV Infections* / epidemiology,Herbal Medicine*,Hospitals,Humans,Malawi / epidemiology,Prevalence",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35233272

It produces a series of metabolic and functional changes in the body. There are multiple limitations in the classic parameters for nutrition assessment including body mass index, weight loss, food intake, or standard laboratory parameters such as albumin or lymphocytes. We can establish some points of interest in this new approach to nutrition focused on the assessment of nutritional status by evaluating changes in composition and function using parameters such as PhA and other electrical measurements of bioimpedance, dynamometry, functional tests, muscle ultrasound, or laboratory parameters such as CRP/prealbumin. Each of these parameters has a number of uses and limitations that should be understood when evaluating its ability to diagnose malnutrition as related to disease, its concordance with other tests, and its prognostic value. Emerging nutritional parameters for future use should be sensitive, specific, and interrelated to allow a better understanding of each patient's status at different time points during their disease.",Affiliations 1 Division of Endocrinology and Nutrition.

Objective: Parents' perceptions of being parented in the past and their current parenting as well as adolescents' perceptions of current parenting were explored applying a multi-method approach. Methods: Following written informed consent, a total of 24 interviews with 10 families (dyads of 14 parents and ten adolescents) from Udupi taluk in southern India was conducted. In the first stage, in-depth interviews were conducted with parent participants (Generation 1 (G1)) and in the second stage, adolescents (Generation 2 (G2)) participated in the photovoice component. Multiple forms of data including photographs, journals and interviews facilitated using the SHOWeD model were collected and were analysed thematically using ATLAS.ti(v.8). Results: Subtle changes in reinforcing culture-specific gender norms between generations were elicited. Differences in communication, granting autonomy to female adolescents, and in disciplining methods between G1 and G2 were observed. Warm parenting was transmitted between generations while harsh parenting in G1 in the presence of external social support was discarded in favor of warm parenting in G2. Conclusion: We provide evidence for perceptions of parenting and adolescent behaviors across two generations. Transmission of warm parenting and interruption in the cycle of harsh parenting in the presence of external social support were significant findings.

629,Biological rhythms and chronotherapeutics in depression,"Depressive syndromes are frequent and heterogeneous brain conditions with more than 90% of patients suffering from sleep complaints. Better characterizing this ""sleep"" domain may allow to both better treat acute episodes with existing chronotherapeutics, but also to prevent the manifestation or recurrences of mood disorders. This work aims to i) review theoretical and fundamental data of chronotherapeutics, and ii) provide practical recommendations. Light therapy (LT) can be used as a first-line monotherapy of moderate to severe depression of all subtypes. LT can be also used as a combination with antidepressant to maximize patients' response rates, which has a clear superiority to antidepressant alone. Sleep deprivation (SD) is a rapid and powerful chronotherapeutic with antidepressant responses within hours in 45-60% of patients with unipolar or bipolar depression. Different strategies should be combined to stabilize the SD antidepressant effect, including concomitant medications, repeated SD, combination with sleep phase advance and/or LT (triple chronotherapy). Melatonin treatment is of interest in remitted patients with mood disorder to prevent relapses or recurrences, if a complaint of insomnia, poor sleep quality or phase delay syndrome is associated. During the acute phase, melatonin could be used as an adjuvant treatment for symptoms of insomnia associated with depression. The cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can be recommend to treat insomnia during euthymic phases. The Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) is indicated for the acute treatment of bipolar depression and for the prevention of mood episodes. Chronotherapeutics should always be associated with behavioral measures for healthy sleep.","Affiliations 1 Département de psychiatrie et d'addictologie, AP-HP, GHU Paris Nord, DMU Neurosciences, Hopital Bichat - Claude Bernard, F-75018 Paris, France; GHU Paris - Psychiatry & Neurosciences, 1 rue Cabanis, 75014 Paris, France; Université de Paris, NeuroDiderot, Inserm, F-75019 Paris, France.

An online questionnaire was used as a data collection tool to identify the participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, health statuses and dietary habits and their use of dietary supplements, functional foods and herbal medicines. Setting: Turkey. Participants: The study population was 550 dietitians. Results: In the current study, the participants’ average age was 30·6 ± 9·1 years, and most of them (88·2 %) were women. More than half of the participants (88·9 %) thought that adequate and balanced nutrition would positively affect the course of COVID-19. To avoid COVID-19, 94·5 % of the dietitians used dietary supplements, 46·1 % herbal medicines and 34·9 % functional foods during the pandemic. The most commonly used dietary supplement was fish oil (81·9 %), functional food was vegetables and fruits (80·5 %) and the herbal medicine was cinnamon (63·5 %). Women’s consumption of functional foods was approximately twice higher compared with men (95 % Cl: 1·048, 4·165; P < 0·05). The findings showed that the longer the dietitians were in their careers, the more functional foods and herbal medicines they used. Conclusion: During the pandemic, dietitians’ use of foods with protective effects against diseases increased depending on their academic knowledge and experience in nutrition. The findings obtained in the current study suggest that an expert’s opinion should be obtained before using dietary supplements and herbal medicines.","Affiliation 1 Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey.","Hulya Kamarli Altun , Merve Seyda Karacil Ermumcu , Nilgun Seremet Kurklu ",Public Health Nutr,2021 Apr,"Adult,COVID-19 / prevention & control*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Dietary Supplements / statistics & numerical data*,Dietetics / statistics & numerical data,Feeding Behavior,Female,Functional Food / statistics & numerical data*,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Herbal Medicine / statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Nutritionists / psychology,Nutritionists / statistics & numerical data*,SARS-CoV-2,Surveys and Questionnaires,Turkey",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357253
631,"Triadic interactions, parental reflective functioning, and early social-emotional difficulties","Early childhood is a critical period for social-emotional development; during this period, the child's immediate family is the system with the greatest influence on his or her development. The parents' capacity to reflect on the children's ability to process and interact within a social environment, called parental reflective functioning (RF), is considered an important factor in protecting children from highly prevalent social-emotional difficulties and may have a strong influence on children's long-term development. Objective: To describe and analyze the relationships among parents' RF, the quality of the mother-father-child triadic interaction, and children's social-emotional difficulties. Method: A nonexperimental, cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted. Fifty mother-father-child triads, each in a current relationship that included at least one child aged 12-36 months, were evaluated. Sociodemographic background, triadic interaction, parental RF, and social-emotional difficulties were assessed. Results: Triadic interaction was found to have a significant effect on the child's social-emotional difficulties, explaining 9% of the variance. In addition, the mothers' RF had a significant influence on triadic interaction, explaining 19% of the variance. An exploratory finding showed that triadic interaction mediates the relationship between mothers' RF and children's social-emotional difficulties.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile. 2 Psychology School, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Macul, Santiago, Chile.","María José León , Marcia Olhaberry ",Infant Ment Health J,2020 Jul,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Child, Preschool,Cross-Sectional Studies,Emotions / physiology*,Family Relations,Female,Humans,Infant,Male,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Social Environment*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32057127
632,Parental Emotion Regulation and Mentalization in Families of Children With ADHD,"Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the role of parental emotion regulation (ER) and parental mentalization as possible contributors to hostile and coercive parenting in families of children with ADHD. Method: Seventy-four Israeli families (64 mothers and 48 fathers) seeking parent training for child ADHD completed measures during the intake session. Measures included parental ER; parental mentalization; hostile, coercive, and submissive parenting; and child symptoms. Results: Findings suggested a relationship between parental ER and coercive parenting independent of child age, symptom level, and parental mentalization. Parental mentalization appeared to buffer against hostility specifically among parents with low ER capacities. Patterns were parallel for mothers and fathers. Conclusion: Study findings highlight the importance of evaluating and addressing parental ER in interventions attempting to reduce coercive parenting. The findings also highlight the potential role of parental mentalization as a protective mechanism against hostile parenting in families of children with ADHD.","Affiliations 1 The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. 2 Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA.","Naama Gershy , Sarah A O Gray ",J Atten Disord,2020 Dec,"Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*,Child,Emotional Regulation*,Female,Humans,Male,Mentalization*,Mothers,Parenting,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29561213

634,The mechanisms of baicalin ameliorate obesity and hyperlipidemia through a network pharmacology approach,"Obesity is one of the main causes of human cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Baicalin, a bioactive flavonoid isolated from the herbal medicine Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, is reported to ameliorate obesity and hyperlipidemia. However, its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we used network pharmacology to explore the potential mechanism of baicalin on a system level. First, we predicted the targets of baicalin and diseases, and then protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment was performed via the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) server. Lastly, we confirmed the results of the network analysis by palmitic acid (PA) treated human hepatoma cells (HepG2) in vitro. The results indicated that 37 targets related to obesity treated by baicalin were predicted by network pharmacology, and top 10 related pathways were extracted by the KEGG database. Baicalin treatment could reduce triglyceride (TG) contents and lipid droplet accumulation in PA-treated HepG2 cells. The anti-obesity effects of baicalin might be due to the up-regulation of solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1) and down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and caspase 3 (CASP3). Our results indicated that baicalin may regulate key inflammatory markers, adipogenesis process, and apoptosis for treatment of obesity.","Affiliations 1 State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 24 Tongjia Lane, Nanjing, 210009, China. 2 State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 24 Tongjia Lane, Nanjing, 210009, China.

635,Toxicity of herbal medications suggested as treatment for COVID-19: A narrative review,"Objectives: In the absence of a definitive cure, herbal medications are gaining increasing popularity in the general public for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although many herbal preparations are safe and can be used without complication, serious toxicities do occur. This article focuses on the major characteristics and toxicities of herbal preparations that have been proposed as treatments for COVID-19. Methods: A review was performed focusing on herbal preparations that have gained popularity as potential treatments for COVID-19. Some of these preparations have been directly recommended by government agencies, whereas others have gained popularity through various other news sources. Results: The herbal preparations covered in this paper include the cardiac glycoside oleandrin, plants of the Datura genus, and herbs commonly used in traditional Chinese Medicine including plants of the Aconitum genus, bitter apricot seeds, ephedra, and licorice root. Conclusion: Although herbal preparations have been reported to aid in the treatment of COVID-19 with success, few clinical trials have been performed to evaluate their efficacy and instead rely mainly on in vitro studies and anecdotal reports. Furthermore, many of the herbal preparations suggested carry significant toxicities, and frontline healthcare workers should be aware of the common symptoms and toxidromes that result from these poisonings.",Affiliation 1 Department of Emergency Medicine Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Newark New Jersey USA.,"Michael A DiPietro , Christopher Mondie ",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,2021 Mar 31,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33817690
636,Applied Barcoding: The Practicalities of DNA Testing for Herbals,"DNA barcoding is a widely accepted technique for the identification of plant materials, and its application to the authentication of commercial medicinal plants has attracted significant attention. The incorporation of DNA-based technologies into the quality testing protocols of international pharmacopoeias represents a step-change in status, requiring the establishment of standardized, reliable and reproducible methods. The process by which this can be achieved for any herbal medicine is described, using Hypericum perforatum L. (St John's Wort) and potential adulterant Hypericum species as a case study. A range of practical issues are considered including quality control of DNA sequences from public repositories and the construction of individual curated databases, choice of DNA barcode region(s) and the identification of informative polymorphic nucleotide sequences. A decision tree informs the structure of the manuscript and provides a template to guide the development of future DNA barcode tests for herbals.","Affiliations 1 Biomolecular Technology Group, Leicester School of Allied Health Science, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester LE1 9BH, UK. 2 BP-NIBSC Herbal Laboratory, National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar EN6 3QG, UK.","Caroline Howard , Claire Lockie-Williams , Adrian Slater ",Plants (Basel),2020 Sep 4,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32899738

638,Effects of sleep restriction on the sleep electroencephalogram of adolescents,"Study objectives: This report describes findings from an ongoing longitudinal study of the effects of varied sleep durations on wake and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and daytime function in adolescents. Here, we focus on the effects of age and time in bed (TIB) on total sleep time (TST) and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) EEG. Methods: We studied 77 participants (41 male) ranging in age from 9.9 to 16.2 years over the 3 years of this study. Each year, participants adhered to each of three different sleep schedules: four consecutive nights of 7, 8.5, or 10 h TIB. Results: Altering TIB successfully modified TST, which averaged 406, 472 and 530 min on the fourth night of 7, 8.5, and 10 h TIB, respectively. As predicted by homeostatic models, shorter sleep durations produced higher delta power in both NREM and REM although these effects were small. Restricted sleep more substantially reduced alpha power in both NREM and REM sleep. In NREM but not REM sleep, sleep restriction strongly reduced both the all-night accumulation of sigma EEG activity (11-15 Hz energy) and the rate of sigma production (11-15 Hz power). Conclusions: The EEG changes in response to TIB reduction are evidence of insufficient sleep recovery. The decrease in sigma activity presumably reflects depressed sleep spindle activity and suggests a manner by which sleep restriction reduces waking cognitive function in adolescents. Our results thus far demonstrate that relatively modest TIB manipulations provide a useful tool for investigating adolescent sleep biology.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of California Davis. 2 Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. 3 Ilia State University, Tbilisi.","Ian G Campbell , Alejandro Cruz-Basilio , Nato Darchia , Zoey Y Zhang , Irwin Feinberg ",Sleep,2021 Jun 11,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adolescent,Child,Electroencephalography,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Sleep Deprivation,Sleep Stages*,Sleep*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33507305

In spite of the studies done on herbal medicine, no study has addressed use of herbal medicine among pregnant women in Debre Tabor Town. Hence, the major aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of herbal medicine use and associated factors. Methods: A community based explanatory sequential mixed methods was employed. The quantitative method used cross-sectional study design with a sample size of 267 women, also 12 participants in a group for focus group discussion and 6 in-depth interviews from focus group were included for a qualitative part using a purposive sampling technique. The data were coded and entered into Epidata 4.2.0.0 and analysis was done using SPSS version 25, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses were used to assess associations between dependent and independent variables. Results: Ninety-five (36.3%) of pregnant women used herbal medicine during pregnancy. Prior use of herbal medicine (AOR: 3.138; 95% CI: 1.375, 7.162), unable to read & write (AOR: 9.316; 95% CI: 2.339, 37.101), presence of health problems (AOR: 3.263; 95% CI: 1.502, 7.090), drug availability (AOR: 9.872; 95% CI: 4.322, 22.551) and distance to the health facilities (AOR 6.153; 95% CI 2.487, 15.226) were significantly associated with use of herbal medicine. Only 5(5.3%) of herbal medicine users disclosed their herbal medicine use to their healthcare providers. Zingiber officinale, Eucalyptus globulus, Rutachalepensis, Linumusitatissimum, and Moringa stenopetala were the most commonly used herbal medicines by pregnant women. Conclusions: The use of herbal medicine during pregnancy is a common practice and significantly associated with educational status, prior use of herbal medicine, presence of health problems, drug availability and distance to the health facilities. Since there was high prevalence and low disclosure rate of herbal medicine use, it should be ensured that physicians/midwives establish a good level of communication with pregnant women.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Debre Tabor University, Debra Tabor, Ethiopia. 2 Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine & Health Sciences, Wollo University, Dessie, Ethiopia. 3 Department of Pharmacy, College of Medicine & Health Sciences, Wollo University, Dessie, Ethiopia. mesfin.haile@wu.edu.et.","Getu Tesfaw Addis , Birhanu Demeke Workneh , Mesfin Haile Kahissay ",BMC Complement Med Ther,2021 Oct 26,"Adolescent,Adult,Cross-Sectional Studies,Ethiopia,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Herbal Medicine / statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Middle Aged,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / drug therapy*,Pregnant Women*,Surveys and Questionnaires,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34702241
640,Regulatory Role of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Regulated Neuronal Death,"Ischemic neuronal injury results from a complex series of pathophysiological events, including oxidative, excitotoxicity, inflammation and nitrative stress. Consequently, many of these events can induce cell death, including necrosis (unregulated cell death) and apoptosis (a type of regulated cell death). These are long-established paradigms to which newly discovered regulated cell death processes have been added, such as necroptosis (a regulated form of necrosis) and autophagydependent cell death. Moreover, many researchers have targeted products associated with Chinese herbal medicine at regulated pathways for the treatment of ischemic neuronal injury. In East Asia, these drugs have been known for centuries to protect and improve the nervous system. Herbal extracts, especially those used in Chinese herbal medicine, have emerged as new pharmaceuticals for the treatment of ischemic neuronal injury. Here, we review the evidence from preclinical studies investigating the neuroprotective properties and therapeutic application of Chinese herbal medicines (Chinese herbal monomer, extract, and medicinal compounds) and highlight the potential mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects via targeting differently regulated cell death pathways. Notably, many herbs have been shown to target multiple mechanisms of regulated cell death and, in combination, may exert synergistic effects on signaling pathways, thereby attenuating multiple aspects of ischemic pathology. In this review, we summarize a generally regulated pathway of cell death as a target for novel natural herbal regimens against ischemic neuronal injury.","Affiliations 1 Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China. 2 Clinical Medicine Eight-year Program, 02 Class, 17 Grade, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China. 3 Department of Human Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Science, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830001, China.","Xiuyu Wu , Ximin Hu , Qi Zhang , Fengxia Liu , Kun Xiong ",CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets,2021 Oct 26,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Apoptosis / drug effects,Drugs, Chinese Herbal / pharmacology*,Humans,Inflammation / drug therapy,Medicine, Chinese Traditional / methods*,Neurons / drug effects,Neuroprotective Agents / pharmacology,Regulated Cell Death / drug effects*,Signal Transduction / drug effects,Drugs, Chinese Herbal,Neuroprotective Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32744977
641,Moderation of parenting by inhibitory control in the prediction of the common and unique variance of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention,"This study examined whether the interaction between parenting and inhibitory control predicts hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention in 195 children. Observation data of positive parenting were collected at 4 years, and mother reports of coercive parenting at 5 years, inhibitory control at 6 years, and hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention at 7 years were obtained. The common and unique variance of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms were examined as outcomes using a bifactor model. Results indicated that positive parenting practices predicted lower levels of hyperactivity-impulsivity/inattention behaviors at age 7 only when children's inhibitory control was high. These results support the vantage sensitivity model, which posits that some individuals show an increased sensitivity to positive experiences exclusively, and support the appropriateness of a targeted prevention approach in early childhood.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec, Canada. 2 CHU Ste-Justine Research Center, Montréal, Quebec, Canada. 3 School of Psychoeducation, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec, Canada. 4 Department of Psychiatry and Addictology, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec, Canada. 5 Department of Pediatrics, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Quebec, Canada. 6 School of Public Health, Physiotherapy & Population Science, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.","Charlie Rioux , Julie Murray , Natalie Castellanos-Ryan , Jean R Séguin , Richard E Tremblay , Sophie Parent ",Dev Psychopathol,2020 Aug,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*,Child,Child, Preschool,Cognition,Female,Humans,Impulsive Behavior,Mothers,Parenting*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31409437

644,Herbal Nephropathy,"An estimated one-third of adults in developed countries and more than 80% of the population in many low- and middle-income countries use herbal and traditional medicines to promote health or for the treatment of common diseases. Herbal medicines can cause kidney damage as a result of intrinsic toxicity, adulteration, contamination, replacement, misidentification, mistaken labeling, and unfavorable herb-drug interactions. The kidneys, due to their high blood flow rate, large endothelial surface area, high metabolic activity, active uptake by tubular cells, medullary interstitial concentration, and low urine pH are particularly vulnerable to development of toxic injury in the form of different syndromes like acute kidney injury, nephrolithiasis, chronic interstitial fibrosis, or uroepithelial cancer. Herbal medicines can also cause crystalluria or hypertension and some could increase potassium blood levels in patients with kidney damage. It is of critical importance that health care organizations around the world regulate herbal and traditional remedies in order to reduce the risk of herb-toxic acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. The nephrologist must be aware of the potential nephrotoxicity from herbal medicine and supplements. A careful history and specific questioning about use of herbal medicines use is essential.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology/Universidad Mayor de San Simon/Hospital Obrero No 2 - CNS, Cochabamba, Bolivia. 2 Departamento de Nefrología y Metabolismo Mineral, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City, Mexico.","Rolando Claure-Del Granado , María Espinosa-Cuevas ",Contrib Nephrol,2021,"Review,Acute Kidney Injury* / chemically induced,Health Promotion*,Herbal Medicine,Humans,Kidney,Phytotherapy / adverse effects",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34343992
645,Sleep reactivation did not boost suppression-induced forgetting,"Sleep's role in memory consolidation is widely acknowledged, but its role in weakening memories is still debated. Memory weakening is evolutionary beneficial and makes an integral contribution to cognition. We sought evidence on whether sleep-based memory reactivation can facilitate memory suppression. Participants learned pairs of associable words (e.g., DIET-CREAM) and were then exposed to hint words (e.g., DIET) and instructed to either recall (""think"") or suppress (""no-think"") the corresponding target words (e.g., CREAM). As expected, suppression impaired retention when tested immediately after a 90-min nap. To test if reactivation could selectively enhance memory suppression during sleep, we unobtrusively presented one of two sounds conveying suppression instructions during sleep, followed by hint words. Results showed that targeted memory reactivation did not enhance suppression-induced forgetting. Although not predicted, post-hoc analyses revealed that sleep cues strengthened memory, but only for suppressed pairs that were weakly encoded before sleep. The results leave open the question of whether memory suppression can be augmented during sleep, but suggest strategies for future studies manipulating memory suppression during sleep. Additionally, our findings support the notion that sleep reactivation is particularly beneficial for weakly encoded information, which may be prioritized for consolidation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA. eitan.schechtman@northwestern.edu. 2 Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, 60208, USA. 3 MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 7EF, UK.","Eitan Schechtman , Anna Lampe , Brianna J Wilson , Eunbi Kwon , Michael C Anderson , Ken A Paller ",Sci Rep,2021 Jan 14,"Clinical Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Adolescent,Adult,Female,Humans,Male,Memory Consolidation / physiology*,Mental Recall / physiology*,Sleep / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33446812
646,What parents want to know in the first postnatal year: A Delphi consensus study,"Background: Early postnatal psychoeducation intervention programmes can support new parents in the adjustment to parenthood. However, most psychoeducation programmes focus on pregnancy and the birth and fail to deliver relevant and age-specific information to new parents about what to expect in the postpartum period. Learning more about this intense period in a new parent's life will facilitate a healthy transition to parenthood. Considering the needs of time-poor but tech-savvy new parents, it is also necessary to rethink the delivery methods of such information to maximize impact. Method: Two panels of experts in perinatal mental health (eight professionals and eight parents with lived experience) participated in a Delphi consensus study to establish what topics of information are most important for parents in the first postnatal year. Results: A total of 89 topics of information were endorsed by at least 80% of both panels as Essential or Good to Know information for new parents. The topics were grouped under the following themes: sleep, attachment, co-parenting, parental mental health, developmental milestones, feeding, social and community support, safety and health. Conclusions: This study established consensus between perinatal experts and parents with lived experience in order to produce relevant m-health psychoeducation for parents in the first postnatal year.

647,Dreams and nightmares in healthy adults and in patients with sleep and neurological disorders,"Dreams are experiences that occur during sleep, while we are disconnected from the environment. Thanks to recent progress in neuroimaging techniques, it is now becoming possible to relate dream features to specific patterns of brain activity. Some conditions occurring in patients with neurological disorders, such as lucid dreams and parasomnias, not only have diagnostic value, but also offer a window into the dream process. They show that dreaming is reflected in physiological signals, behaviours, and brain activity patterns, and that the body can enact dream content. Yet, the dream body can also be distinct from the real body; in their dreams, patients with congenital paraplegia can walk, those with sleep apnoea rarely suffocate, and phantom limb pain can disappear. These conditions provide valuable models for future studies investigating the mechanisms that underlie oneiric experiences.","Affiliations 1 Center for Investigation and Research on Sleep and Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland. 2 Department of Psychology, and Turku Brain and Mind Center, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Department of Cognitive Neuroscience and Philosophy, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden; Department of Perioperative Services, Intensive Care and Pain Medicine, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. 3 Paris Brain Institute, Paris, France; Sorbonne University, Paris, France; Sleep Disorders Unit, Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris, France.

648,Characterization of sleep in six patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration,"Background: Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a rare neurologic disorder included in the group of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation diseases (NBIA). Information regarding sleep in patients with PKAN is limited. Objectives: To describe the clinical and polysomnographic characteristics of sleep in six patients with genetically confirmed PKAN. Methods: The evaluation included a clinical interview, sleep questionnaires -Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)- and a video-polysomnography (VPSG). In addition to standard sleep measures we manually quantified sleep spindle density in stage N2 and rapid eye movements in REM sleep comparing the results with matched controls. Quantification of EMG activity in REM sleep was performed following standard criteria. Results: All the patients reported at least one sleep complaint, most commonly sleep fragmentation (4/6) and sleep onset insomnia (3/6). ESS and PSQI were abnormal in 3/6 and 4/6, respectively. VPSG showed in 4/6 decreased ocular movements during REM sleep, an increase in sleep spindles in 3/6 (all of them with deep brain pallidal stimulation), an absence of slow wave sleep in 2 and undifferentiated NREM sleep and delayed sleep phase in one. Three patients had an abnormal sleep apnea/hypopnea index, and 2 periodic limb movements of sleep. REM sleep muscular atonia was preserved in all. Conclusions: Sleep disorders are common in patients with PKAN. Although our sample is small and heterogeneous, with different symptomatic treatments possibly influencing the results, it suggests that evaluation of sleep should be considered in their management.","Affiliations 1 Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Unit, Neurology Department, Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

649,"Child disclosure, parental solicitation, and adjustment problems: Parental support as a mediator","Little is known about how perceived parental solicitation and child disclosure are negatively associated with early adolescent adjustment problems and/or if these associations are consistent across race/ethnic groups. This study used data from 209 early adolescents to examine perceived parental support as a mediator in the associations between perceived parental solicitation and child disclosure and subsequent adjustment problems, while also examining race/ethnic group differences across non-Hispanic White and Hispanic early adolescents using multi-group path analyses. Perceived parent support did not mediate the associations between child disclosure and perceived parental solicitation and subsequent adjustment problems. However, child disclosure was directly associated with subsequent conduct problems for Hispanic adolescents. Child disclosure and perceived parental solicitation may positively influence the parent-adolescent relationship by increasing parental support but may not entirely help in reducing the prevalence of adjustment problems. Child disclosure may be particularly beneficial for Hispanic early adolescents in reducing adjustment problems.","Affiliations 1 Department of Public Health Sciences, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1120 NW 14th Street, Suite 1018, Miami, FL, 33136, USA. axm2508@miami.edu. 2 Department of Kinesiology and Health Education, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.","Alejandra Fernandez , Alexandra Loukas , Keryn E Pasch ",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,2021 Jun,"Adolescent,Adolescent Behavior,Child,Depression / psychology,Disclosure*,Emotional Adjustment*,Female,Hispanic or Latino / psychology*,Humans,Male,Negotiating,Parent-Child Relations / ethnology*,Parenting / ethnology*,Parenting / psychology,Parents,Problem Behavior / psychology,Social Support,Whites / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32712742
650,Pregnancy-associated cancers: frequency and temporal trends in Italy,"Objective: Limited data are available on the frequency and time trends of pregnancy-associated cancers, particularly from Southern European countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and time trends of pregnancy-associated cancer in Italy. Methods: This was a population-based linkage study using the regional hospital discharge forms database of four Italian regions with more than 17 million inhabitants. All resident women with a hospital discharge form reporting a birth or abortion in the time period under consideration were identified. The time period of the study was 2003-2015 for the Piemonte and Puglia region, 2006-2015 for the Tuscany region, and 2005-2015 for the Veneto region. Risk of developing a pregnancy-associated cancer was calculated as the ratio of the number of pregnancy-related cancers to the total number of pregnancies. Results: A total of 2 297 648 pregnancies were identified. Overall, the pregnancy-associated cancer frequency was 134.8 per 100 000 pregnancies: the frequency ranged from 127.1 in Puglia to 157.3 in Tuscany. The frequency for 100 000 pregnancies was 66.4 in women aged <30 years; the risk increased with age, with a frequency of 275.6 among women aged 40+ years. Approximately two-thirds of cancers were associated with pregnancies resulting in a delivery and one-third with pregnancies resulting in a termination of pregnancy or spontaneous pregnancy loss. No clear trend emerged in the risk of pregnancy-associated cancer per 100 000 pregnancies and calendar year. Conclusion: No clear time trend was observed in the frequency of pregnancy-associated cancers in Italy during the last 10 years, the rates being 104, 164, and 130 per 100 000 pregnancies, respectively, in 2003, 2010, and 2015.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Neonatology, University of Milan, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. 2 Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pisa University Hospital, Pisa, Italy. 3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, 'Aldo Moro' University of Bari, Bari, Italy. 4 Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dell'Angelo Hospital, Mestre, Italy. 5 Division of Gynecologic Oncology, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy. 6 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Neonatology, University of Milan, La Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore di Milano Policlinico, Milan, Italy elenaroncella87@gmail.com. 7 Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy. 8 Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. 9 Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.","Fabio Parazzini , Angiolo Gadducci , Ettore Cicinelli , Tiziano Maggino , Fedro Peccatori , Giovanna Scarfone , Elena Roncella , Giovanni Scambia , Paolo Zola , Enrico Sartori ",Int J Gynecol Cancer,2020 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Female,Humans,Italy / epidemiology,Neoplasms / epidemiology*,Pregnancy / statistics & numerical data*,Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic / epidemiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31744888
651,Dietitian encounters after treatment for ovarian cancer,"Background: After ovarian cancer treatment, women report health issues that may be amenable to change with dietary support. The present study investigated how many women encounter a dietitian post-treatment and the factors associated with dietitian service use. Methods: We used data from a cohort of women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer to identify socio-economic, clinical and personal factors associated with dietitian encounter after treatment completion. Data were collected at regular intervals using validated questionnaires up to 4 years post-treatment completion. Logistic regression (LR) and generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to assess factors associated with dietitian encounter at any time-point post-treatment (LR), as well as in the 3 months prior to a follow-up questionnaire (GLMM) to assess time-varying factors. Results: Of 819 women, 97 (12%) reported seeing a dietitian post-treatment. Factors associated with dietitian encounter were being overweight (ORLR = 1.7, CI = 1.1-2.8), having poorer self-rated health (ORLR = 2.5, CI = 1.2-5.2; ORGLMM = 2.3, CI = 1.2-4.4) or poorer diet quality (ORLR = 0.5, CI = 0.2-1.0) pre-diagnosis, treatment within the public health system (ORGLMM = 1.8, CI = 1.2-2.7), previous support from dietetic (ORLR = 3.1, CI = 1.8-5.4; ORGLMM = 2.8, CI = 1.8-4.2) or other allied health services (ORLR = 2.0, CI = 1.2-3.2; ORGLMM = 3.7, CI = 2.4-5.5), and having progressive disease at follow-up (ORGLMM = 2.2, CI = 1.4-3.3). Most women (86%) with ≥ 3 moderate-to-severe nutrition impact symptoms did not report a dietitian encounter post-treatment. Conclusions: Few women encounter a dietitian post-treatment for ovarian cancer, including those with multiple nutrition impact symptoms. Further work is needed to engage those likely to benefit from dietitian support but less likely to seek or receive it.","Affiliations 1 Population Health Department, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. 2 Faculty of Health, School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, QLD, Australia.","Elizabeth A Johnston , Torukiri I Ibiebele , Jolieke C van der Pols , Penelope M Webb , OPAL Study Group",J Hum Nutr Diet,2021 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial,Dietetics*,Female,Humans,Nutritional Status,Nutritionists*,Ovarian Neoplasms* / therapy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33749900
652,The Efficacy of Brief Parent-Infant Psychotherapy for Treating Early Regulatory Disorders: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective: Early regulatory disorders (ERD) place considerable strain on the parent-infant relationship and are associated with high parental distress. Brief (4-session) psychodynamic-based focused parent-infant psychotherapy (fPIP) treats ERD by strengthening the quality of the parent-infant relationship. This randomized controlled trial investigates the efficacy of fPIP for treating ERD compared to standard pediatric care (treatment as usual [TAU]). Method: Participants were 154 mothers and infants from 4 to 15 months who met criteria for persistent excessive crying, sleeping disorders, feeding disorders, or regulation disorders of sensory processing and were randomly assigned to fPIP (n = 81) or TAU (n = 73). Assessments took place at baseline and at the end of treatment after 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were the infants' regulatory symptoms and remission rate. Secondary outcomes were parents' psychological distress, depression, parenting stress, maternal self-efficacy, parental reflective functioning, and observer-rated emotional availability. Results: fPIP was superior to TAU in reducing infants' overall symptoms (p = .004, η2 = 0.05, CI = 0.01-0.12), night-waking disorders (p = .030, odds ratio = 3.12, CI = 1.21-9.22), and mothers' psychological distress (p = .000, η2 = 0.08, CI = 0.03-0.16) and depression (p = .002, η2 = 0.06, CI = 0.02-0.13). There was a trend suggesting that fPIP led to increased maternal self-efficacy and parental reflective functioning. Conclusion: Results underscore the efficacy of brief fPIP in significantly reducing symptoms in infants with ERD and their mothers. Generalizability is restricted to low psychosocial risk samples with highly distressed mothers and comorbid ERD with a predominance of night-waking disorders.

653,Uncaria tomentosa (cat's claw): a promising herbal medicine against SARS-CoV-2/ACE-2 junction and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein based on molecular modeling,"COVID-19 is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Currently, there is no effective treatment and vaccines seem to be the solution in the future. Virtual screening of potential drugs against the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has provided small molecular compounds with a high binding affinity. Unfortunately, most of these drugs do not attach with the binding interface of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) complex in host cells. Molecular modeling was carried out to evaluate the potential antiviral properties of the components of the medicinal herb Uncaria tomentosa (cat's claw) focusing on the binding interface of the RBD-ACE-2 and the viral spike protein. The in silico approach starts with protein-ligand docking of 26 Cat's claw key components followed by molecular dynamics simulations and re-docked calculations. Finally, we carried out drug-likeness calculations for the most qualified cat's claw components. The structural bioinformatics approaches led to the identification of several bioactive compounds of U. tomentosa with potential therapeutic effect by dual strong interaction with interface of the RBD-ACE-2 and the ACE-2 binding site on SARS-CoV-2 RBD viral spike. In addition, in silico drug-likeness indices for these components were calculated and showed good predicted therapeutic profiles of these phytochemicals found in U. tomentosa (cat's claw). Our findings suggest the potential effectiveness of cat's claw as complementary and/or alternative medicine for COVID-19 treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Dietary supplements (DSs) and herbal medicine provide a potentially convenient and accessible method for its recovery, but direct evidence is limited. Objective: This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of DSs and herbs in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in multiple electronic English and Chinese databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving DSs or herbal medicine interventions on patients with COVID-19 from November 2019 to February 2021 were included. Data was extracted, summarized and critically examined. Results: Out of 9402 records identified in the initial search, twelve RCTs were included in this review. Risk of bias of these RCTs was deemed high. Most of the trials were of low methodologic quality. Nine studies showed herbal supplements were beneficial to the recovery of COVID-19 patients; zinc sulfate could shorten the duration of loss of smell but not total recovery from COVID-19. No severe adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Herbal supplements may help patients with COVID-19, zinc sulfate is likely to shorten the duration of olfactory dysfunction. DS therapy and herbal medicine appear to be safe and effective adjuvant therapies for patients with COVID-19. These results must be interpreted with caution due to the overall low quality of the included trials. More well-designed RCTs are needed in the future.","Affiliations 1 Medical College of Acu-Moxi and Rehabilitation, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. 2 Division of General Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. 3 Department of Rehabilitation, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, 1333 Xinhu Road, Shenzhen, 518100, Guangdong, China. 4 Department of Rehabilitation, Shenzhen Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (Futian), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. 5 Formula- Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. 6 Division of Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA. 7 Department of Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA; Department of Integrative Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.

We analyzed the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, a classification of the Chinese medicine dialectic and treatment regimen, and promptly enacted the recommendation of Korean medicine preparations in herbal medicine covered under domestic medical insurance benefits depending on the circumstances in our country. Method: The clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 was developed based on consensus from a group of experts. Results: Two kinds of herbal medicines (HM) were recommended for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgitang, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Saengmaek-san. Two herbal preparations were recommended for people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgi-tang. Three herbal preparations were recommended for mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Galgunhaegui-tang was recommended for those without pneumonia with wind-warmth disease invading the lungs; Sosiho-tang plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san was recommended for those with dampness-heat disease in the lungs. For the recovery stage, Samchulkunbi-tang plus Saengmaek-san, or Samchulkunbi-tang plus Chungseuiki-tang was recommended. Conclusion: The CPG was developed to guide the use of Korean herbal medicine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, and it is expected that this will be the basis for providing proper treatment of similar infectious diseases in the future.","Affiliations 1 Division of Allergy, Immune and Respiratory System, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University Seoul, Republic of Korea. 2 Hwapyeong Institute of Integrative Medicine, Incheon, Republic of Korea. 3 Korean Medicine Hospital of Pusan National University, Gyeongsangnam-do, Republic of Korea. 4 School of Korean Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.","Beom-Joon Lee , Ju Ah Lee , Kwan-Il Kim , Jun-Yong Choi , Hee-Jae Jung ",Integr Med Res,2020 Sep,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32691002
656,Rapid eye movement sleep is initiated by basolateral amygdala dopamine signaling in mice,The sleep cycle is characterized by alternating non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleeps. The mechanisms by which this cycle is generated are incompletely understood. We found that a transient increase of dopamine (DA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during NREM sleep terminates NREM sleep and initiates REM sleep. DA acts on dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2)-expressing neurons in the BLA to induce the NREM-to-REM transition. This mechanism also plays a role in cataplectic attacks-a pathological intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness-in narcoleptics. These results show a critical role of DA signaling in the BLA in initiating REM sleep and provide a neuronal basis for sleep cycle generation.,"Affiliations 1 International Institute for Integrative Sleep Medicine (WPI-IIIS), University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan. 3 State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Peking University School of Life Sciences, Beijing 100871, China. 4 Life Science Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance (TARA), University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.","Emi Hasegawa , Ai Miyasaka , Katsuyasu Sakurai , Yoan Cherasse , Yulong Li , Takeshi Sakurai ",Science,2022 Mar 4,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Basolateral Nuclear Complex / metabolism*,Cataplexy / physiopathology,Dopamine / metabolism*,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurons / metabolism,Receptors, Dopamine D2 / metabolism,Signal Transduction,Sleep / physiology,Sleep, REM / physiology*,Wakefulness,DRD2 protein, mouse,Receptors, Dopamine D2,Dopamine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35239361
657,Sleep Spindles Preferentially Consolidate Weakly Encoded Memories,"Sleep has been shown to be critical for memory consolidation, with some research suggesting that certain memories are prioritized for consolidation. Initial strength of a memory appears to be an important boundary condition in determining which memories are consolidated during sleep. However, the role of consolidation-mediating oscillations, such as sleep spindles and slow oscillations, in this preferential consolidation has not been explored. Here, 54 human participants (76% female) studied pairs of words to three distinct encoding strengths, with recall being tested immediately following learning and again 6 h later. Thirty-six had a 2 h nap opportunity following learning, while the remaining 18 remained awake throughout. Results showed that, across 6 h awake, weakly encoded memories deteriorated the fastest. In the nap group, however, this effect was attenuated, with forgetting rates equivalent across encoding strengths. Within the nap group, consolidation of weakly encoded items was associated with fast sleep spindle density during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, sleep spindles that were coupled to slow oscillations predicted the consolidation of weak memories independently of uncoupled sleep spindles. These relationships were unique to weakly encoded items, with spindles not correlating with memory for intermediate or strong items. This suggests that sleep spindles facilitate memory consolidation, guided in part by memory strength.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Given the countless pieces of information we encode each day, how does the brain select which memories to commit to long-term storage? Sleep is known to aid in memory consolidation, and it appears that certain memories are prioritized to receive this benefit. Here, we found that, compared with staying awake, sleep was associated with better memory for weakly encoded information. This suggests that sleep helps attenuate the forgetting of weak memory traces. Fast sleep spindles, a hallmark oscillation of non-rapid eye movement sleep, mediate consolidation processes. We extend this to show that fast spindles were uniquely associated with the consolidation of weakly encoded memories. This provides new evidence for preferential sleep-based consolidation and elucidates a physiological correlate of this benefit.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana 46556 ddenis@nd.edu. 2 Department of Psychiatry, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02215. 3 Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215. 4 Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129. 5 Athinoula A.

658,The relationship between body composition and sleep architecture in athletes,"Sleep is essential for athletes to recover physical fitness. It has been suggested that sleep is affected by muscle volume. Compared to female athletes, male athletes with greater muscle volume may have inferior objective sleep quality. This study aimed to assess the relationship between body composition and objective sleep parameters in male and female athletes. The body composition of 17 male and 19 female collegiate athletes were measured, and they underwent overnight home sleep monitoring. Compared with female athletes, male athletes had more muscle mass and less fat mass. Moreover, male athletes had lower sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset latency, higher arousal index, less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and lower percentage of slow-wave (N3) sleep in the initial non-REM sleep. Furthermore, the percentage of muscle mass was inversely related, whereas fat mass or percentage of fat mass was directly related to the percentage of N3 sleep in the initial non-REM sleep. Overall, there were no significant association between sex and sleep parameters. However, a significant correlation was found within both subgroups. Objective sleep quality was suggested to be worse in male athletes than in female athletes, implying that sleep architecture may be related to the muscle volume.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. 2 Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Cardiovascular Respiratory Sleep Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Cardiovascular Management and Remote Monitoring, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Sleep and Sleep-Disordered Breathing Center, Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

659,A pre-trial evaluation of blinding for a Chinese herbal medicine trial,"Background: Blinding is considered an important methodological characteristic in clinical trials to minimise bias and maximise the validity of a trial. Unlike pharmaceutical substances, most herbal medicines have distinctive sensory specifications, including odour and taste, which can be quite challenging when developing a placebo control to match the specific characteristics of herbal substances being examined. The present study was, therefore, designed to evaluate whether the participants could differentiate an active herbal capsule (Ganopoly combination) from a placebo material capsule. The aim of this study was to develop a suitable placebo substance for encapsulation to be used in a future herbal medicine clinical trial. Methods: The current study was improved upon the previous investigation, and several modifications were made to the placebo substance in order to mimic the herbal substance characteristics. Prior to conducting the study, a refined placebo substance was developed using commonly consumed culinary agents. Sixty-two healthy volunteers participated in the study and were randomly provided one of the two substances. Individuals were asked to evaluate the three sensory characteristics of the allocated capsule (visual appearance, odour, and taste), and determine whether they believed the substance to be a 'herbal' or a 'placebo' substance. Results: The study provided evidence on the success of blinding for only two sensory characteristics, namely, visual appearance (95% CI -0.15, 0.34) and odour (95% CI -0.34, 0.15). In contrast, the findings related to the taste indicated that participants correctly guessed the herbal substance compared to the placebo substance to a significantly higher proportion than would have been expected by chance alone (95% CI 0.14, 0.60). Conclusion: The failure to blind participants for taste highlights the difficulties in preparing placebo herbal substances that match as closely as possible to a real herbal substance. Blinding is particularly challenging where herbal medicines have different sensory characteristics.","Affiliation 1 School of Life Sciences, University of Technology Sydney, 2007, New South Wales, Australia.","Shohreh Razavy , John Lee , Christopher Zaslawski ",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,2020 Aug 5,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32817905

In fact, traditional or herbal medicine have a big influence on people's decisions about their health. Materials and methods: This report describes the community belief in herbal medicine that provides immunity to COVID-19 infection. Results: In the early pandemic, there were so many false and misinformation about herbal that can cure COVID-19. They use mainly herbs and spices, eucalyptus oil, arak Bali as the alternative of COVID-19 remedies. People's interest in using herbal also shown in the market influx of these things. In a condition where demand is higher than supply, the market ran out of stocks and the prices also sharply increased. Continuous research that uses herbal medicine as an alternative approach to COVID-19 treatment are still ongoing. Nevertheless, as of now, there is no concrete scientific evidence to support the use of traditional medicine in the treatment and management of COVID-19. Conclusion: These facts reflect that COVID-19 vaccine will face challenges in community. These challenges include misinformation, misleading information, cultures, and believes that potentially interfere the vaccination process. COVID-19 vaccine should get a place in peoples' heart and mind thus can at least eliminate the pandemic.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine, PKU Muhammadiyah Bantul General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. 2 Department of Medicine, Majenang General Hospital, Central Java, Indonesia. 3 Department of Medicine, Nyi Ageng Serang General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.","Firdian Makrufardi , Ade Saputri , Paulin Surya Phillabertha ",Afr J Infect Dis,2021 Mar 18,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33889795

Most parenting interventions emphasize the acquisition of knowledge and skills; however, this overlooks the deleterious effects of chronic stress on parenting. The Caregiver Support Intervention (CSI) aims to strengthen quality of parenting skills by lowering stress and improving psychosocial wellbeing among refugee caregivers of children aged 3-12 years, while also increasing knowledge and skills related to positive parenting. The CSI is a nine-session psychosocial group intervention delivered by non-specialist providers. It is intended for all adult primary caregivers of children in high-adversity communities, rather than specifically targeting caregivers already showing signs of elevated distress. Methods/design: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the CSI through a parallel group randomized controlled study with Syrian refugee families in North Lebanon. Participants will be primary caregivers of children aged 3-12 years, with one index child per family. Families will be randomized to the CSI or a waitlist control group. A total of 240 families (480 caregivers) will be recruited into the study. Randomization will be at the family level, and CSI groups will be held separately for women and men. The study will be implemented in two waves. Outcomes for both arms will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome is quality of parenting skills. Secondary outcomes include parental warmth and sensitivity, harsh parenting, parenting knowledge, and child psychosocial wellbeing. Putative mediators of the CSI on parenting are caregiver stress, distress, psychosocial wellbeing, and stress management. Discussion: This trial may establish the CSI as an effective intervention for strengthening parenting in families living in settings of high adversity, particularly refugee communities.

662,Enhancing Connections-Palliative Care: A Quasi-Experimental Pilot Feasibility Study of a Cancer Parenting Program,"Background: In 2018, >75,000 children were newly affected by the diagnosis of advanced cancer in a parent. Unfortunately, few programs exist to help parents and their children manage the impact of advanced disease together as a family. The Enhancing Connections-Palliative Care (EC-PC) parenting program was developed in response to this gap. Objective: (1) Assess the feasibility of the EC-PC parenting program (recruitment, enrollment, and retention); (2) test the short-term impact of the program on changes in parent and child outcomes; and (3) explore the relationship between parents' physical and psychological symptoms with program outcomes. Design: Quasi-experimental two-group design employing both within- and between-subjects analyses to examine change over time and change relative to historical controls. Parents participated in five telephone-delivered and fully manualized behavioral intervention sessions at two-week intervals, delivered by trained nurses. Behavioral assessments were obtained at baseline and at three months on parents' depressed mood, anxiety, parenting skills, parenting self-efficacy, and symptom distress as well as children's behavioral-emotional adjustment (internalizing, externalizing, and anxiety/depression). Subjects: Parents diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancer and receiving noncurative treatment were eligible for the trial provided they had one or more children aged 5-17 living at home, were able to read, write, and speak English, and were not enrolled in a hospice program. Results: Of those enrolled, 62% completed all intervention sessions and post-intervention assessments. Within-group analyses showed significant improvements in parents' self-efficacy in helping their children manage pressures from the parent's cancer; parents' skills to elicit children's cancer-related concerns; and parents' skills to help their children cope with the cancer. Between-group analyses revealed comparable improvements with historical controls on parents' anxiety, depressed mood, self-efficacy, parenting skills, and children's behavioral-emotional adjustment. Conclusion: The EC-PC parenting program shows promise in significantly improving parents' skills and confidence in supporting their child about the cancer. Further testing of the program is warranted.","Affiliations 1 University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. 2 Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. 3 Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. 4 The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas. 5 New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico. 6 Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC.","Frances Marcus Lewis , Elizabeth Trice Loggers , Farya Phillips , Rebecca Palacios , Kenneth P Tercyak , Kristin A Griffith , Mary Ellen Shands , Ellen H Zahlis , Zainab Alzawad , Hebah Ahmed Almulla ",J Palliat Med,2020 Feb,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Feasibility Studies,Humans,Neoplasms*,Palliative Care,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31613703
663,Effects of Herbal Medicines on Pain Management,"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience in many diseases and is often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. Pain negatively affects the quality of life and increases high health expenditures. Drugs with analgesic properties are commonly used to relieve pain, but these Western medications could be overwhelmed by side effects including tolerance and addiction. Herbal medicines may provide alternative measures for pain management. In this review paper, after introduction of Chinese medicine theory and treatment modality, emphasis is placed on the application of Chinese herbs and herbal formulations in pain management. Three of the most commonly used herbs, i.e., Corydalis yanhusuo, Ligusticum chuanxiong, and Aconitum carmichaeli, are reviewed. Subsequently, using this ancient medical remedy, Chinese herbal formulation in treating common medical conditions associated with pain, such as headache/migraine, chest pain, abdominal pain, low back pain, neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, and cancer pain, is presented. Chinese herbal medicines could be considered as a complementary and integrative approach in the modern armamentarium in combating pain.","Affiliations 1 Key Laboratory of Modern Preparation of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Education, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, P.

664,"Pregnancy intendedness, maternal-fetal bonding, and postnatal maternal-infant bonding","This study models associations between pregnancy intendedness and prenatal maternal-fetal bonding with postnatal maternal-infant bonding. Unintended pregnancies are associated with disruptions in maternal-infant bonding, which has long-term adverse implications for maternal and child well-being. Given the high proportion of births that are unintended in the United States, identifying protective factors is critical. Pregnant women (ages 16-38) were recruited from two prenatal clinics in a metropolitan city in the South Central United States at their first prenatal visit and followed throughout pregnancy and postbirth. Multiple regression analyses examined associations, mediation, and moderation. Results indicate that the more unintended/unwanted women reported their pregnancies to be, the lower they reported their maternal-infant bonding postbirth, and higher maternal-fetal bonding scores are associated with higher postnatal maternal-infant bonding. An interaction revealed that a higher level of prenatal bonding is protective for postnatal bonding among those with unintended/unwanted pregnancies. Because prenatal bonding can be enhanced through intervention, it is a promising target to reduce the risks associated with unintended pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Human Development and Family Science, Oklahoma State University, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. 2 Department of Human Development and Family Science, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA. 3 Center for Research on Childhood Adversity, Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA.","Karina M Shreffler , Tiffany N Spierling , Jens E Jespersen , Stacy Tiemeyer ",Infant Ment Health J,2021 May,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Mother-Child Relations*,Object Attachment*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned,Pregnant Women,Prenatal Care,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33860552
665,Chinese herbal medicine for mild cognitive impairment using mini-mental state examination: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the elderly population aged 60 to 84 years ranges from 6.7% to 25.2%, and the effective prevention and reversal of MCI progression to Alzheimer disease (AD) is crucial. The mini mental state examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used screening tool in Chinese outpatient clinics, with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to allow useful stratification from average to abnormal with adequate consideration of age and education. Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of Chinese herbs on MMSE scores in MCI patients and discuss the effectiveness of Chinese herbs through pharmacology. Methods: Three English databases and 4 Chinese databases we have searched, and the risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane tool. Statistics will be used for heterogeneity assessment, sensitivity analysis, data synthesis, funnel plot generation and subgroup analysis. If sufficiently homogeneous studies are found, a Meta-analysis will be performed, with subgroups describing any differences. Results: A total of 21 studies were included, 4 studies were placebo-controlled, 14 Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHMs) were compared with other cognitive improvements, 3 CHMs were combined with other medications, and the results of 17 studies favored the herbal group. Conclusion: The results indicate that herbal medicine can improve MMSE scores, and herbal medicine combined with other drugs that can improve cognition can significantly improve MMSE scores, but there are methodological flaws in the study. Experimental studies have found a basis for the ability of herbs to improve cognition and memory impairment, and herbal medicine has great potential to improve MCI cognition.

666,"""You Have Made All the Loving Choices"": Good Parent Praise in Pediatric Critical Care Conferences","Background and objectives: Parents' ideas about what it means to be a ""good parent"" to their seriously ill child influence parental decision-making. Little is known about when, why, and how clinicians offer good-parent praise or how parents react. Our objective was to describe clinicians' spontaneous use of good-parent praise statements to parents during PICU care conferences and how parents respond. Methods: Single-center, cross-sectional review of 72 transcripts of audio-recorded PICU care conferences in a quaternary medical center. Qualitative analysis was conducted to code triggers for clinician good-parent statements and parent responses. Results: Clinicians made at least one statement of good-parent praise in 32% of family conferences. Triggers for clinician statements of good-parent praise were categorized into 6 themes: decision making, gratitude to the clinical team, defense of parenting, parental body language, parental guilt, and intention to close the meeting. Parental responses to clinician statements of good-parent praise fell into 6 themes: acknowledgment, medical talk, deepening of feelings expressed in conversation, focusing on a decision, redirecting on the patient, and gratitude. Conclusions: Clinicians spontaneously praised parents for their role in being a good parent in less than one-third of family conferences. Clinician statements were triggered by verbal and nonverbal parental behaviors, a critical decision-making point in the conversation, and an intention to close the meeting. In response, parents frequently responded positively to the praise and often returned the gratitude or reflected on their feelings about caregiving for their child.","Affiliations 1 Center for Comprehensive Care, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio; amysporter@me.com. 2 Nursing Research and Quality Outcomes and. 3 Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, Washington, DC. 4 Department of Critical Care Medicine, Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC; and.","Amy S Porter , Pamela S Hinds , Jessica D Livingston , Tessie W October ",Hosp Pediatr,2021 May,"Child,Critical Care,Cross-Sectional Studies,Decision Making*,Humans,Parenting,Parents,Professional-Family Relations*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33883232
667,Molecular Basis of the Therapeutical Potential of Clove ( Syzygium aromaticum L.) and Clues to Its Anti-COVID-19 Utility,"The current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is enormously affecting the worldwide health and economy. In the wait for an effective global immunization, the development of a specific therapeutic protocol to treat COVID-19 patients is clearly necessary as a short-term solution of the problem. Drug repurposing and herbal medicine represent two of the most explored strategies for an anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) is a well-known culinary spice that has been used for centuries in folk medicine in many disorders. Interestingly, traditional medicines have used clove since ancient times to treat respiratory ailments, whilst clove ingredients show antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Other interesting features are the clove antithrombotic, immunostimulatory, and antibacterial effects. Thus, in this review, we discuss the potential role of clove in the frame of anti-COVID-19 therapy, focusing on the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic effects of clove and its molecular constituents described in the scientific literature.","Affiliations 1 Istituto di Biostrutture e Bioimmagini IBB-CNR, Via Tommaso De Amicis 95, 80145 Naples, Italy. 2 Department of Chemical Materials and Industrial Production Engineering (DICMaPI), University of Naples Federico II, Piazzale V.

668,Estimating Sleep Stages Using a Head Acceleration Sensor,"Sleep disruption from causes, such as changes in lifestyle, stress from aging, family issues, or life pressures are a growing phenomenon that can lead to serious health problems. As such, sleep disorders need to be identified and addressed early on. In recent years, studies have investigated sleep patterns through body movement information collected by wristwatch-type devices or cameras. However, these methods capture only the individual's awake and sleep states and lack sufficient information to identify specific sleep stages. The aim of this study was to use a 3-axis accelerometer attached to an individual's head to capture information that can identify three specific sleep stages: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, light sleep, and deep sleep. These stages are measured by heart rate features captured by a ballistocardiogram and body movement. The sleep experiment was conducted for two nights among eight healthy adult men. According to the leave-one-out cross-validation results, the F-scores were: awake 76.6%, REM sleep 52.7%, light sleep 78.2%, and deep sleep 67.8%. The accuracy was 74.6% for the four estimates. This proposed measurement system was able to estimate the sleep stages with high accuracy simply by using the acceleration in the individual's head.","Affiliations 1 Department of Robotics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University Graduate Schools, Shiga 525-8577, Japan. 2 Department of Robotics, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga 525-8577, Japan. 3 MD-4 Lab., Samsung R&D Institute Japan, Osaka 562-0036, Japan.","Motoki Yoshihi , Shima Okada , Tianyi Wang , Toshihiro Kitajima , Masaaki Makikawa ",Sensors (Basel),2021 Feb 1,"Acceleration,Adult,Humans,Male,Sleep,Sleep Stages*,Sleep, REM*,Wakefulness",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33535422
669,The Impact of Child Autistic Symptoms on Parental Marital Relationship: Parenting and Coparenting Processes as Mediating Mechanisms,"Research shows that parenting a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with increased marital conflicts and reduced marital love. Less is known, however, about the potential mechanism underlying these associations. The present study tested a family process model linking child autism to parental marriage. We hypothesized that child autistic symptoms would be associated with increased marital conflicts and reduced marital love among parents of children with ASD, and that these associations would be mediated by parenting stress and coparenting conflicts. A total of 382 parents of children with ASD from Hong Kong, China completed questionnaire measures of child autistic symptoms, parenting stress, coparenting conflicts, marital conflicts, and marital love. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and Bootstrap analyses were conducted to analyze the relations among the variables. SEM showed that child autistic symptoms were related to higher levels of parenting stress and coparenting conflicts, which were, in turn, related to increased marital conflicts and reduced marital love among parents of children with ASD. Bootstrap analyses further demonstrated that child autistic symptoms had significant indirect effects on marital conflicts and marital love via parenting stress and coparenting conflicts. Theoretically, this study revealed the potential pathways through which child autism symptomatology may adversely impact the family processes and compromise the marital relationships of parents of children with ASD. Practically, this study pointed to the utility of helping parents of children with ASD to manage child autistic symptoms, alleviate parenting stress, and reduce coparenting conflicts in improving their marital qualities. LAY SUMMARY: This study showed that child autistic symptoms were related to higher levels of parenting stress and coparenting conflicts, which were, in turn, related to increased marital conflicts and reduced marital love among parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These findings pointed to the importance of helping parents of children with ASD to manage child autistic symptoms, alleviate parenting stress, and reduce coparenting conflicts in improving their marital qualities. © 2020 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

670,"Effects and safety of herbal medicines among community-dwelling residents during COVID-19 pandemic: A large prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT)","Background: Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, countries are struggling with a shortage of medical capacities. It would be essential if the risk for preventable comorbidities, such as the common cold, can be reduced or prevented, so that the scarce medical resources and facilities can be focused on COVID-19. Purpose: To evaluate the effects of two herbal medicines (Jinhaoartemisia antipyretic granules and Huoxiangzhengqi oral liquids) in reducing the risk of the common cold in community-dwelling residents in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Study design: A prospective open-label, parallel-group, cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT), was conducted in Chengdu, China. Methods: A total of 22,065 participants from 11 communities were recruited during a period of one month. The trial started on 30 January and participants were followed up till 29 February 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a five-day herbal medicine therapy plus a reference manual or a reference manual only if they were allocated to the control group. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of patient-reported common cold symptoms. The secondary endpoint was the time in days from the receipt of herbal drugs/reference manual and the occurrence of the common cold symptoms. Results: Use of herbal medicine reduced the risk of the common cold by 89.6% (95% CI, 52.9% to 97.7%) in all community-dwelling residents, and by 94.0% (95% CI, 52.1% to 99.2%) in residents aged between 16 and 59 years old. Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. Conclusion: This community-based RCT found that the use of a herbal medicine therapy (Jinhaoartemisia antipyretic granules and Huoxiangzhengqi oral liquids) could significantly reduce the risks of the common cold among community-dwelling residents, suggesting that herbal medicine may be a useful approach for public health intervention to minimize preventable morbidity during COVID-19 outbreak.","Affiliations 1 Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China. 2 BeijingKeyTech Statistical Consulting Co.

671,A comparison of primary care parenting programs for Latinx families,"Introduction: Primary care agencies remain an ideal setting for implementing parenting programs that meet the needs of Latinx parents. However, little to no research has been done on how well adapted primary care parenting programs (PCPPs) are to the beliefs, values, and practices of many Latinx families. Method: Using 5 inclusion criteria, 8 PCPPs were selected and compared across 8 domains: focus, age of child, composition, sequence, duration, training length, estimated start-up costs, and number of cultural adaptations. Results: PCPPs vary widely across all 8 domains, with some PCPPs being relatively brief and low cost and others more all encompassing and expensive. Only 4 of the 8 programs demonstrated cultural adaptations outside Spanish translation. Conclusion: This comparison demonstrates that there is a lack of cultural consideration among researchers who develop PCPPs. Recommendations for providing culturally attuned parenting services for Latinx families within a primary care environment are given.

672,Stigma in relation to families living with parental mental illness: An integrative review,"Stigma is a pervasive social mechanism with negative ramifications for people who experience mental illness. Less is known about the stigma experiences of families where a parent has a mental illness. This review aims to identify and synthesize evidence on the concept of stigma and stigma-related experiences and outcomes reported by parents and children living with parental mental illness. An integrative review method was employed, with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to search and select literature and extract and analyse data. This approach allows for inclusion of theoretical and empirical literature and for concept definition. Fifty-eight papers, mostly from the USA, Australia, and the UK, met the inclusion criteria. Stigma was primarily conceptualized in families as a marked difference that was negatively appraised, and which could be internalized. Some articles examined how underpinning assumptions could shape the behaviour of individuals and groups and be embedded within social institutions and structures. For parents, mental illness stigma was interconnected with stigma relating to perceived violations of social and cultural norms related to parenting. Children's experience of stigma resulted in bullying, embarrassment, guilt and social isolation, and efforts to conceal their parent's mental illness. One outcome was that stigma prevented children and parents from seeking much needed supports. Public health policies and campaigns that focus exclusively on promoting open disclosure of mental illness to foster community education outcomes are unlikely to be effective without additional strategies aimed at preventing and redressing the structural impacts of stigma for all family members.","Affiliations 1 Professional Psychology Programs in Education, Krongold Clinic, Faculty of Education, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 2 Centre for Critical Qualitative Health Research, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 3 South West Healthcare, Warrnambool, Australia. 4 School of Rural Health, Monash University, Warragul, Australia. 5 School of Applied Social Sciences, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK. 6 Faculty of Education, Monash University, Wellington Road, Clayton, 3800, Australia. 7 School of Social Work, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 8 University Centre for Psychiatry, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. 9 School of Nursing, Midwifery & Paramedicine, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 10 North Western Mental Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.","Andrea Reupert , Brenda Gladstone , Rochelle Helena Hine , Scott Yates , Violette McGaw , Grant Charles , Louisa Drost , Kim Foster ",Int J Ment Health Nurs,2021 Feb,"Meta-Analysis,Systematic Review,Australia,Child,Humans,Mental Disorders*,Parenting,Parents,Social Stigma*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33283387
673,"Sleep duration, midday napping, and sleep quality and incident stroke: The Dongfeng-Tongji cohort","Objective: To investigate the associations of sleep duration, midday napping, sleep quality, and change in sleep duration with risk of incident stroke and stroke subtypes. Methods: Among 31,750 participants aged 61.7 years on average at baseline from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, we used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident stroke. Results: Compared with sleeping 7 to <8 hours/night, those reporting longer sleep duration (≥9 hours/night) had a greater risk of total stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.41), while shorter sleep (<6 hours/night) had no significant effect on stroke risk. The HR (95% CI) of total stroke was 1.25 (1.03-1.53) for midday napping >90 minutes vs 1-30 minutes. The results were similar for ischemic stroke. Compared with good sleep quality, those with poor sleep quality showed a 29%, 28%, and 56% higher risk of total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Moreover, we observed significant joint effects of sleeping ≥9 hours/night and midday napping >90 minutes (HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.28-2.66), and sleeping ≥9 hours/night and poor sleep quality (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.33-2.48) on risk of total stroke. Furthermore, compared with persistently sleeping 7-9 hours/night, those who persistently slept ≥9 hours/night or switched from 7 to 9 hours to ≥9 hours/night had a higher risk of total stroke. Conclusions: Long sleep duration, long midday napping, and poor sleep quality were independently and jointly associated with higher risks of incident stroke. Persistently long sleep duration or switch from average to long sleep duration increased the risk of stroke.","Affiliations 1 From the Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, Ministry of Education and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating) (L.Z., K.Y., L.Y., H.W., Y.X., G.Q., X.L., Y.Y., Y.B., M.H., T.W., X.Z.), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan; Department of Cardiovascular Diseases (X.L., H.Y.), Sinopharm Dongfeng General Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan; and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (C.W.), College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, China. 2 From the Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, Ministry of Education and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating) (L.Z., K.Y., L.Y., H.W., Y.X., G.Q., X.L., Y.Y., Y.B., M.H., T.W., X.Z.), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan; Department of Cardiovascular Diseases (X.L., H.Y.), Sinopharm Dongfeng General Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan; and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (C.W.), College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, China. mingxz117@163.com wut@mails.tjmu.edu.cn.","Lue Zhou , Kuai Yu , Liangle Yang , Hao Wang , Yang Xiao , Gaokun Qiu , Xuezhen Liu , Yu Yuan , Yansen Bai , Xiulou Li , Handong Yang , Meian He , Chongjian Wang , Tangchun Wu , Xiaomin Zhang ",Neurology,2020 Jan 28,"Aged,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Male,Middle Aged,Sleep / physiology*,Stroke / epidemiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31827003

676,Ulipristal acetate and pregnancy outcome-an observational study,"Study question: Is the failure of the selective progesterone receptor modulator ulipristal acetate (UPA) as emergency contraception (EC; 30 mg, single) or inadvertent exposure for myoma treatment (5 mg/d) in pregnancy associated with a higher risk of birth defects, spontaneous abortion (SAB) or elective termination of pregnancy (ETOP)? Summary answer: We did not find an increased risk for birth defects, SABs or ETOPs after UPA exposure during implantation and early embryogenesis. What is known already: Pregnancy outcome data after exposure to UPA are very limited. In cases of EC failure or unplanned pregnancy during myoma treatment, women need well-grounded risk assessment to minimize anxiety and prevent unjustified termination of pregnancy. Study design, size, duration: Observational study of prospectively ascertained pregnancies from the German Embryotox institute with UPA exposure (EC, n = 95; myoma, n = 7). Four retrospectively reported pregnancy outcomes were evaluated separately. Participants/materials, setting, methods: A total of 226 requests on ulipristal were directed to the German Embryotox institute during the study period 2010-2018. Outcomes of pregnancies exposed-(i) precycle, (ii) preconceptional or (iii) first trimester-were ascertained using standardized questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were applied. Main results and the role of chance: Failed EC with UPA resulted in 95 prospectively ascertained pregnancies, of which 56 had completed follow-up: 37 live births, 7 SABs and 12 ETOPs. There was no major birth defect. Just 34% of women had taken UPA during the fertile window. Seven prospectively enrolled pregnancies were treated for myoma and had known pregnancy outcomes: five healthy live births and two SABs. Among the four retrospectively reported pregnancies after EC, there was one child diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Limitations, reasons for caution: Our limited sample size does not allow concluding safety of UPA use in pregnancy. Wider implications of the findings: We provide a preliminary basis for reassuring women who wish to carry their pregnancy to term after EC or myoma treatment with UPA. However, because of the report of a BWS after UPA exposure, a possible epigenetic effect could not be excluded and requires further evaluation. Study funding/competing interest(s): This work was performed with financial support from the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. Trial registration number: Registered with the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00015155).","Affiliation 1 Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Pharmakovigilanz- und Beratungszentrum für Embryonaltoxikologie, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Berlin, Germany.","Jenny Katharina Wagner , Katarina Dathe , Christof Schaefer , Maria Hoeltzenbein ",Hum Reprod,2020 Apr 28,"Observational Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Contraception, Postcoital*,Embryo Implantation,Female,Humans,Norpregnadienes,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*,Retrospective Studies,Norpregnadienes,ulipristal acetate",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32322890

679,"No cognitive processing in the unconscious, anesthetic-like, state of sleep","We review evidence challenging the hypothesis that memories are processed or consolidated in sleep. We argue that the brain is in an unconscious state in sleep, akin to general anesthesia (GA), and hence is incapable of meaningful cognitive processing-the sole purview of waking consciousness. At minimum, the encoding of memories in sleep would require that waking events are faithfully transferred to and reproduced in sleep. Remarkably, however, this has never been demonstrated, as waking experiences are never truly replicated in sleep but rather appear in very altered or distorted forms. General anesthetics (GAs) exert their effects through endogenous sleep-wake control systems and accordingly GA and sleep share several common features: sensory blockade, immobility, amnesia and lack of awareness (unconsciousness). The loss of consciousness in non-REM (NREM) sleep or to GAs is characterized by: (a) delta oscillations throughout the cortex; (b) marked reductions in neural activity (from waking) over widespread regions of the cortex, most pronounced in frontal and parietal cortices; and (c) a significant disruption of the functional connectivity of thalamocortical and corticocortical networks, particularly those involved in ""higher order"" cognitive functions. Several (experimental) reports in animals and humans have shown that disrupting the activity of the cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, severely impairs higher order cognitive and executive functions. The profound and widespread deactivation of the cortex in the unconscious states of NREM sleep or GA would be expected to produce an equivalent, or undoubtedly a much greater, disruptive effect on mnemonic and cognitive functions. In conclusion, we contend that the unconscious, severely altered state of the brain in NREM sleep would negate any possibility of cognitive processing in NREM sleep.","Affiliations 1 Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, USA. 2 Department of Psychology, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.","Robert P Vertes , Stephanie B Linley ",J Comp Neurol,2021 Feb,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Review,Anesthesia, General* / methods,Animals,Cerebral Cortex / drug effects,Cerebral Cortex / physiology*,Cognition / drug effects,Cognition / physiology*,Dreams / drug effects,Dreams / physiology*,Electroencephalography / drug effects,Electroencephalography / methods,Humans,Sleep / drug effects,Sleep / physiology*,Unconsciousness / chemically induced,Unconsciousness / physiopathology*,Wakefulness / drug effects,Wakefulness / physiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32472571
680,Traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treating novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: A new type of coronavirus, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), is causing an increasing number of cases of pneumonia and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020. The virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, and traditional Chinese herbal medicine is being used for its treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess studies of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We will search electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang database using keywords related to COVID-19 and traditional Chinese herbal medicine. Reference lists of relevant trials and reviews will be searched. We will manually search gray literature, such as conference proceedings and academic degree dissertations, and trial registries. Two independent reviewers will screen studies (XL and DZ), extract data (YL and LG), and evaluate risk of bias (YL and DZ). Data analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3.5) and R software (version 3.6.1). Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard chi-square test with a significance level of P < 0.10. Biases associated with study size (e.g., publication bias) will be investigated using funnel plots, Egger's test and Begg's test, and Trim and Fill analysis. Discussion: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19. The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treatment or prevention of these novel viral infections affecting the pneumonia will be investigated.

681,[Mental Disorders and Parenting: Challenges and Opportunities for Adult Mental Health Services],"Mental Disorders and Parenting: Challenges and Opportunities for Adult Mental Health Services Parenting can be a key element in the psychiatric rehabilitation process, but it may come with many challenges for parents with mental health problems. Illness symptoms, together with social and sociocultural factors, can have adverse effects on family life or parenting behaviors and entail severe consequences for a child's psychosocial development. Bidirectional interactions can increase parental burden and thus worsen a parent's course of illness. This vicious circle can be broken by the provision of early and adequate support of mothers and fathers with mental health problems. Adult mental health services can make an important yet often underestimated contribution here. This article refers to parents' resources and needs and introduces both opportunities and challenges for adult mental health services when it comes to dealing with parenting needs. Mental health professionals are in a pivotal position for extending adequate support to clients on their parental needs. These professionals' skills and knowledge regarding parenting are essential for the successful implementation of family-focused practices in adult mental health services. Beyond the individual level, there is a need for policies and guidelines stipulating the integration of family and child perspectives in adult mental health services. In a broader view, a program from Finland shows how mental health professionals as well as peers can support parents and their families during the treatment process.",Affiliation 1 Universität Ulm Klinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie II am Bezirkskrankenhaus Günzburg Ludwig-Heilmeyer-Str. 2 89312 Günzburg Deutschland Universität Ulm.,"Silvia Krumm , Bitta Söderblom , Tytti Solantaus ",Prax Kinderpsychol Kinderpsychiatr,2020 Sep,"Adult,Child,Child of Impaired Parents / psychology*,Disease Susceptibility,Female,Humans,Male,Mental Disorders / prevention & control,Mental Disorders / rehabilitation,Mental Disorders / therapy*,Mental Health Services*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32886047

However, recent decriminalization policies and new scientific evidence have increased the interest in cannabis therapeutic potential of cannabis and paved the way for the release of marketing authorizations for cannabis-based products. Although several synthetic and standardized products are currently available on the market, patients' preferences lean towards herbal preparations, because they are easy to handle and self-administer. A literature search was conducted on multidisciplinary research databases and international agencies or institutional websites. Despite the growing popularity of medical cannabis, little data is available on the chemical composition and preparation methods of medical cannabis extracts. The authors hereby report the most common cannabis preparations, presenting their medical indications, routes of administration and recommended dosages.

683,Traditional herbal medicine and nanomedicine: Converging disciplines to improve therapeutic efficacy and human health,"Traditional herbal medicine (THM), an ancient science, is a gift from nature. For thousands of years, it has helped humans fight diseases and protect life, health, and reproduction. Nanomedicine, a newer discipline has evolved from exploitation of the unique nanoscale morphology and is widely used in diagnosis, imaging, drug delivery, and other biomedical fields. Although THM and nanomedicine differ greatly in time span and discipline dimensions, they are closely related and are even evolving toward integration and convergence. This review begins with the history and latest research progress of THM and nanomedicine, expounding their respective developmental trajectory. It then discusses the overlapping connectivity and relevance of the two fields, including nanoaggregates generated in herbal medicine decoctions, the application of nanotechnology in the delivery and treatment of natural active ingredients, and the influence of physiological regulatory capability of THM on the in vivo fate of nanoparticles.

684,Herbal medicine from the perspective of type II diabetic patients and physicians: what is the relationship?,"Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem and one of the most challenging diseases worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has the second highest rate of diabetes in the Middle East and seventh highest globally. Some diabetic patients may prefer to use alternative approaches such as herbal remedies to control their blood glucose level and this study aims to assess the prevalence of herbal usage and to evaluate users' and doctors' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about herbal medicine as well as the patient/doctor relationship in this regard. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in several hospitals and medical centres in Makkah, KSA, between January and March 2019. Around 289 type II diabetic patients and 105 doctors were interviewed. Results: We found that 68% of the participants were frequent consumers of herbal remedies, especially cinnamon, ginger and fenugreek. Patients' knowledge of herbal usage was mainly gleaned from family and friends as well as social media, and we found that many (71.4%) did not bother to consult or inform their doctors about their choice to self-medicate with herbs. Patients had no concerns regarding the efficacy and safety of herbal usage use in diabetes, as around half of the participants believe that herbal medicine is effective (54%) and safe (46%) for treating symptoms of diabetes. Two-thirds of the doctors (66%) routinely ask patients whether they use herbs for their condition. Although 25% of the doctors took a positive view of herbal medicine in relation to diabetes, others expressed concerns with the rise in herb use and want to see more attention paid to safety aspects. Conclusion: The study concludes that herbal remedies are commonly used by diabetic patients and that a gap exists in the relationship between patients and doctors concerning the disclosure of herbal remedy use and views on its safety.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmacognosy, Pharmacy College, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, 21955, Saudi Arabia. aaqathama@uqu.edu.sa. 2 Department of Pharmacognosy, Pharmacy College, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, 21955, Saudi Arabia. 3 Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy Practice, College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.","Aljawharah Alqathama , Ghadeer Alluhiabi , Halah Baghdadi , Lujain Aljahani , Ola Khan , Sara Jabal , Shorooq Makkawi , Farah Alhomoud ",BMC Complement Med Ther,2020 Feb 28,"Multicenter Study,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Cross-Sectional Studies,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 / drug therapy*,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Herbal Medicine / statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Patient Acceptance of Health Care*,Physician-Patient Relations*,Phytotherapy / statistics & numerical data*,Prevalence,Saudi Arabia,Surveys and Questionnaires,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32111222

686,Sleep of preschoolers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a significantly large number of psychological consequences, including sleep health. The present study evaluated sleep patterns, sleep disturbances, and associated factors in Chinese preschoolers confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. Caregivers of 1619 preschoolers (aged 4-6 years) recruited from 11 preschools in Zunyi, Guizhou province completed the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) between 17th and 19th February 2020. Data were compared to a sociodemographically similar sample of preschoolers (included in the 11 preschools) in 2018. Compared to the 2018 sample, the confined preschoolers demonstrated changes in sleep patterns characterized by later bedtimes and wake times, longer nocturnal and shorter nap sleep durations, comparable 24-hr sleep duration, and fewer caregiver-reported sleep disturbances. Moreover, behavioural practices (sleeping arrangement, reduced electronic device use, regular diet) and parenting practices (harmonious family atmosphere and increased parent-child communication) were associated with less sleep disturbances in the confined sample. The present study provides the first description of the impact of prolonged home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep patterns and sleep disturbances in preschoolers, as well as highlighting the importance of the link between sleep health and family factors. Given that disrupted and insufficient sleep has been linked to immune system dysfunction, our findings also have potential implications for resilience to infection in young children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should further explore deficient sleep as a risk factor for coronavirus infection.","Affiliations 1 Division of Applied Psychology, School of Management, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China. 2 Center of Teaching Assessment and Supervision, Zhaoqing University, Zhaoqing, China. 3 Division of Child Health, Zunyi Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Zunyi, China. 4 Department of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institution, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. 5 Department of Neurology, Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders, Boston Children's Hospital, Waltham, MA, USA.","Zhijun Liu , Hui Tang , Qiyun Jin , Guanghai Wang , Zixin Yang , Hongyan Chen , Hongxia Yan , Wenjie Rao , Judith Owens ",J Sleep Res,2021 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,COVID-19 / epidemiology*,Child,Child, Preschool,Disease Outbreaks,Family Health / statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Male,Pandemics,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting / psychology,Polysomnography,Risk Factors,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Deprivation / epidemiology,Sleep Hygiene / physiology,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32716566
687,[Modeling of chronic sleep restriction for translational studies],"Objective: To develop of a chronic sleep restriction model in rats by repeated sleep deprivation using an orbital shaker and to determine whether this model leads to disturbances in sleep homeostatic mechanisms. Material and methods: Male Wistar rats (7-8 months old) underwent sleep restriction for five consecutive days: 3 h of sleep deprivation and 1 h of sleep opportunity repeating throughout each day. Polysomnograms were recorded telemetrically throughout the day before sleep restriction (baseline), on the 1st, 3rd, 5th day of sleep restriction and 2 days after the end of sleep restriction (recovery period). Results: During the period of sleep restriction, the total amount of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased by 61% and 55%, respectively, compared to baseline. On the first day of recovery, amount of SWS increased mainly in the dark (active) phase of the day, while REM sleep increased in both light and dark phases; there was no marked rebound of daily SWS amount, while REM sleep increased by 30% from baseline. On the first day of recovery, an elevation of EEG beta and sigma power in sleep states was observed mainly in the light phase of the day. The loss of deep SWS throughout the sleep restriction period increased from 50% on 1st day to 75% on 5th day. The level of deep SWS remained below the baseline by 15-20% on the two subsequent days of recovery. The findings suggest that homeostatic mechanisms of SWS are persistently impaired after 5-day chronic sleep restriction. Besides, a decline of wakefulness accompanied by an increase of SWS in the active phase of the recovery period indicates a disruption in circadian rhythm. Conclusion: The proposed model leads to the disruption of sleep homeostatic mechanisms, which, in turn, impede compensation of SWS loss caused by chronic insufficient sleep.","Affiliation 1 Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Saint Petersburg, Russia.","M A Guzeev , N S Kurmazov , V V Simonova , Yu F Pastukhov , I V Ekimova ",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,2021,"Animals,Electroencephalography*,Male,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Sleep Deprivation,Sleep*,Sleep, REM,Wakefulness",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34078853
688,Herb-sourced emodin inhibits angiogenesis of breast cancer by targeting VEGFA transcription,"Anti-angiogenesis is an important and promising strategy in cancer therapy. However, the current methods using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) antibodies or inhibitors targeting VEGFA receptors are not as efficient as expected partly due to their low efficiencies in blocking VEGFA signaling in vivo. Until now, there is still no method to effectively block VEGFA production in cancer cells from the very beginning, i.e., from the transcriptional level. Here, we aimed to find bioactive small molecules to block VEGFA transcription. Methods: We screened our natural compound pool containing 330 small molecules derived from Chinese traditional herbs for small molecules activating the expression of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), which is a newly identified potent transcriptional repressor of VEGFA, by a cell-based screening system in MDA-MB-231 cell line. The activities of the candidate molecules on regulating SerRS and VEGFA expression were first tested in breast cancer cells. We next investigated the antiangiogenic activity in vivo by testing the effects of candidate drugs on the vascular development in zebrafish and by matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. We further examined the antitumor activities of candidate drugs in two triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-bearing mouse models. Furthermore, streptavidin-biotin affinity pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation assays, docking analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to identify the direct targets of candidate drugs. Results: We identified emodin that could greatly increase SerRS expression in TNBC cells, consequently reducing VEGFA transcription. Emodin potently inhibited vascular development of zebrafish and blocked tumor angiogenesis in TNBC-bearing mice, greatly improving the survival. We also identified nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCOR2) to be the direct target of emodin. Once bound by emodin, NCOR2 got released from SerRS promoter, resulting in the activation of SerRS expression and eventually the suppression of VEGFA transcription. Conclusion: We discovered a herb-sourced small molecule emodin with the potential for the therapy of TNBC by targeting transcriptional regulators NCOR2 and SerRS to suppress VEGFA transcription and tumor angiogenesis.","Affiliations 1 School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, China. 2 Department of Oncology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China. 3 2011 Project Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy of Ministry of Education, Tianjin 300071, China. 4 State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, China.","Gengyi Zou , Xiaotong Zhang , Lun Wang , Xiyang Li , Tianyu Xie , Jin Zhao , Jie Yan , Longlong Wang , Haoyu Ye , Shunchang Jiao , Rong Xiang , Yi Shi ",Theranostics,2020 May 22,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Angiogenesis Inhibitors / pharmacology*,Animals,Breast Neoplasms / drug therapy*,Breast Neoplasms / metabolism,Breast Neoplasms / pathology,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Movement,Disease Models, Animal,Emodin / pharmacology*,Female,Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic*,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Mice,Mice, Inbred BALB C,Mice, Inbred NOD,Mice, SCID,Neovascularization, Pathologic / metabolism,Neovascularization, Pathologic / pathology,Neovascularization, Pathologic / prevention & control*,Protein Kinase Inhibitors / pharmacology,Serine-tRNA Ligase / metabolism,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A / genetics*,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A / metabolism,Zebrafish / metabolism,Angiogenesis Inhibitors,Protein Kinase Inhibitors,VEGFA protein, human,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,Serine-tRNA Ligase,Emodin",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32550907
689,Children's perceptions of their parent's parenting strategies and child influence on purchases in a supermarket,"This field study identified, through observation, child influence on food and beverage purchases within a supermarket, as well as the influence of the children's perceptions of their parents' parenting strategies related to eating behaviors on these purchases. Four supermarkets were recruited to participate and agreed to allow recruitment of parent-child dyads and implementation of data collection protocols within their stores. Parent-child (7-14 yo) dyads were recruited to wear eye-tracking glasses during the supermarket visit, complete separate individual interviews, and have their store receipts scanned. The receipt data provided evidence of what was purchased, including overall purchases, as well as purchases of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages. The eye-tracking data, together with the receipt data, identified which items were requested by the child and purchased. The child interviews provided the child's perceptions of parenting strategies (i.e., parental monitoring, control). Seventy-six dyads agreed to participate and completed the study protocols. During most of the shopping trips, items were purchased as a result of child-initiated request interactions. Children's perceptions of their parent's use of monitoring was consistently associated with fewer purchases overall and of energy-dense, nutrient-poor items, and with reduced child influence on what was purchased.","Affiliations 1 San Diego State University, Fowler College of Business, Department of Marketing, 5500 Campanile Dr., San Diego, CA, 92182, USA.

690,Bioregenerative life support space diet and nutrition requirements: still seeking accord,"The capability of ""dish"" and ""ingredient in dish"" modeling to reduce the number of nutrition imbalances in bioregenerative life support diet was compared. Masses of dishes were assumed to be the independent variables in the 'dish' model, while in the 'ingredient in dish' model the independent variables were the total masses of the ingredients in a one-day menu and masses of ingredients in the dishes. The objective function in both models was minimization of discrepancy between the calculated nutrition intakes and the daily nutrition requirements of NASA for long duration space missions. Comparing of two models was carried out for the case of a one-day diet containing 12 dishes and 32 ingredients. It was established that the diet simulation by 'dish' model brings 6 nutrition imbalances. The use of the 'ingredient in dish' modeling has helped to reduce the number of nutrition imbalances to 3, namely, an excess of iron, vitamin A and saturated fat. Obstacles to the fulfillment of all nutrition requirements were the nomenclature and masses of ingredients in the dish recipes.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Biophysics of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences, Akademgorodok, Krasnoyarsk, 660036, Russia.

693,Mothers experiences of the Parenting Under Pressure Program (PuP) in a Residential Therapeutic Community: A qualitative study,"Several studies suggest parental substance use, while not always the case, exposes children to a higher risk of physical, psychological, behavioral and emotional problems. Identifying interventions that best support the parent and child needs is imperative. The PuP programme aims to improve family functioning and child outcomes by supporting parents who are or have been drug or alcohol dependent. PuP combines psychological principles relating to parenting, child behavior and parental emotion regulation within a case-management model. The current study was the first evaluation of the PuP program in a residential setting globally. Twenty-three women took part in pre and post-program qualitative interviews. Guilt was a dominant theme across interviews. The principal expectation of participants was to improve their relationships and access to their children. The benefits of the PuP program to the women and their children, as reported by participants, were immediate and direct. As the women progressed through the program, they were visibly building belief in their abilities to parent.","Affiliations 1 Department of Public Health & Primary Care, Institute of Population Health, School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. 2 Coolmine Therapeutic Community Dublin.","Jo-Hanna Ivers , Anita Harris , Pauline McKeown , Joe Barry ",J Psychoactive Drugs,2021 Jul-Aug,"Child,Female,Humans,Mothers*,Parenting*,Parents,Qualitative Research,Therapeutic Community",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33320076
694,Development and validation of the infant crying and parent well-being screening tool,"This article describes the development and validation of the infant crying and parent well-being (ICPW) screening tool, developed to provide an effective and efficient way of identifying families struggling with infant crying and soothing. Construct validity for the ICPW was assessed using survey data from 290 parents of infants. Scores on the ICPW were associated with parental depression, parenting stress, and low co-parent confidence. Parents with positive ICPW screens-indicating additional support is needed-were more likely to have high or clinical levels of parenting stress than parents with negative screens. Inconsolable and excessive infant crying negatively impacts the well-being of parents, and most importantly, is the primary trigger for infant abuse. The ICPW is a unique, efficient tool that allows providers to screen for families who may need additional support around infant crying and soothing.","Affiliations 1 Early Childhood Education, National Louis University, Chicago, Illinois, USA. 2 Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.","Leslie E Katch , Tiffany Burkhardt ",J Community Psychol,2021 Aug,"Crying*,Humans,Infant,Parenting,Parents*,Research,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34033694

This qualitative study sought to identify how early adolescent participants described food-related agency. One-on-one interviews were conducted with 30 early adolescents (10-13 years). Data analysis was guided by Bandura's three modes of agency: personal, proxy, and collective. Results suggest participants' food behaviors were informed by a growing knowledge about nutrition, household food rules, and school food environments. Participants described different modes of agency in four areas - grocery shopping, cooking, consumption decisions, and nutrition information seeking - with varying degrees of agency in each area. Understanding how each of the three modes operate and the interplay between them can information future research aimed at improving the nutrition behaviors of early adolescents.","Affiliations 1 Division of Nutritional Sciences, Savage Hall- Room 214, 244 Garden Avenue, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853, USA.

696,[Advocacy for an improved training in clinical nutrition during the medical cursus],"The knowledge of physicians regarding nutrition is often far below the expectations of patients, and does not comply with official recommendations. However, poor-quality nutrition and diet represent the first cause of mortality worldwide. As a result of an insufficient training and awareness, many physicians cannot meet patients' expectations. Moreover, nutrition is sometimes felt as a field of low scientific level, thereby opening the area to pseudo-scientific drifts. We advocate an improvement in the training in nutrition during the medical cursus, namely by the transversal integration of nutritional insights into medical courses, and the recognition of post-university training validated by the academic authorities. A clarification of the roles and the recognition of the competency are urgently required to promote the professionalism of nutritional counselling.","Affiliations 1 Unité d'Endocrinologie, Diabète et Nutrition, Faculté de Médecine, UCLouvain; Service d'Endocrinologie et Nutrition, Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Bruxelles, Belgique. 2 Direction médicale, Fondation contre le Cancer, Bruxelles, Belgique. 3 Service de Diabétologie, Nutrition et Maladies métaboliques, CHU Liège, ULiège, Belgique. 4 Direction médicale, Hôpital Erasme, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgique.","J P Thissen , A Boucquiau , N Paquot , J C Preiser ",Rev Med Liege,2021 Apr,"Delivery of Health Care,Humans,Malnutrition*,Nutritional Sciences*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33830689

700,Infant-directed language following a brief behavioral parenting intervention: The importance of language quality,"Behavioral parenting interventions decrease early childhood behavior problems and increase positive parenting skills. However, few studies have examined the impact of low intensity interventions for infants at risk for behavior problems on changes in parent language. This study examined the effect of a brief parenting intervention, the Infant Behavior Program, on changes in parent linguistic input and its influence on infant language. Participants were 58 mothers and their12- to 15-month-olds, with elevated levels of behavioral problems. Mothers and their infants were from primarily Hispanic and low-income backgrounds. Mother-infant dyads were randomly assigned to receive the Infant Behavior Program or standard pediatric primary care. Mothers receiving the Infant Behavior Program provided more linguistic input, which indirectly influenced infant language, and suggest targeting infants at risk for behavior problems can have a broader impact on language development.","Affiliations 1 Florida International University, United States.

702,Why do parents use screen media with toddlers? The role of child temperament and parenting stress in early screen use,"Considering child characteristics may be an important piece to understanding parental decision-making for children's screen use. The current cross-sectional study examined the mediating role of maternal parenting stress in the relation of child temperament to young children's screen use. Recognizing the multidimensional aspects of temperament, three mediated pathways for three temperament domains (i.e., negative affectivity, surgency, and effortful control) were tested. Mothers of toddlers, 18-36 months (N = 296), completed an online survey, reporting on child temperament, total parenting stress, and child screen use. The results showed that mother-child dynamics were related to toddlers' screen use. Toddlers' negative affectivity and effortful control were each associated with toddlers' screen use through maternal parenting stress. Higher negative affectivity was associated with higher maternal parenting stress, which in turn, was related to greater screen use in toddlers. Toddlers' lower effortful control was related to higher maternal parenting stress, which in turn, was associated with greater screen use. Toddlers' surgency was not related to either maternal parenting stress or toddlers' screen use. The findings from this study contribute to an understanding of media-related parenting in toddlerhood and may help with the development of strategies for supporting healthy media habits in families with young children.","Affiliations 1 Department of Human Development and Family Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA. 2 Department of Human Development and Family Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA.

703,Parents' use of extreme physical violence is associated with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in children,"Background: Children who grow in settings where parenting is harsh tend to develop a response tendency that may give rise to a chronic pro-inflammatory state. Thus, we aimed to identify if experiencing abuse triggers an increase in the child high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in a population birth cohort, Generation XXI. Methods: At cohort participants age of 7 years, information on parents' disciplinary practices was collected by trained interviewers using the Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child version. Venous blood samples were obtained after overnight fast and hs-CRP was quantified. Results: Of 4175 participants, 44.0% of children reported low frequency of physical violence, 50.1% reported frequent but not severe physical violence, 5.3% reported frequent and severe physical violence, and 0.6% children reported parental extreme physical violence. Higher levels of hs-CRP were observed among children who reported the highest grade of violence severity (58.3%). After adjustment for child's sex, age and parental education, the increasing grade of violence severity increased the odds of higher hs-CRP levels. Limitations: No significant increase in the levels of hs-CRP was found in children exposed to less severe violence. However that does not mean that those forms of violence have no impact on health in the long-term period. Also, the cross-sectional nature of the study prevents us from concluding the directionality of the effects, although we provided theoretical arguments for the proposed pathway. Conclusions: Children physically abused by their parent(s) present heightened inflammation levels. Thus, our results show that stressful events may impact inflammatory processes even at very early ages.","Affiliations 1 EPIUnit - Instituto de Saúde Pública da Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.

704,"A national survey of oncology survivors examining nutrition attitudes, problems and behaviours, and access to dietetic care throughout the cancer journey","Background: Attitudes of cancer survivors to nutrition and nutrition care have rarely been captured. A better understanding of their needs based on a review of their experiences would give voice to this patient group (which has rarely been captured) and allow for better planning of nutritional care. Aims: To conduct a national survey to determine: (1) survivors' experience in relation to nutrition and diet-related problems, (2) perceived importance of the role of nutrition to cancer survivors, (3) the experience of accessing dietetic support, (4) the sources where survivors get nutrition information, and (5) their use of alternative dietary strategies. Methods: Survivors (any adult ever diagnosed with cancer) who had been diagnosed with or treated for cancer in Ireland within the past 5 years, were asked to complete a 25-item paper-based survey at one of 20 different hospital sites in Ireland. The survey was also hosted online on the websites of major cancer charities. Descriptive statistics were used to examine quantitative data. Results: In total, 1073 valid responses were received (63% female, mean age 57 years (range 18-88)). Breast cancer was the most common (n = 362), followed by colorectal (n = 121). One third of respondents had metastatic disease. Diet-related problems were reported by 45%. Weight loss was experienced by 44% and amongst those, 42% reported they were 'unhappy or worried' by this, while 27% reportedbeing 'delighted/happy' with their weight loss. Muscle loss was noted by 52%, with 20% reporting they had noticed 'a lot' of muscle loss. Nutrition was rated as 'very/extremely' important to cancer care by 89% of respondents, yet 58% reported being asked about dietary issues by their medical team only 'sometimes', 'rarely' or 'never'. Only 39% had been assessed/treated by a registered dietitian (RD) and 74% rated their advice/care as 'very/extremely' helpful. Worryingly, 39% of survivors with involuntary weight loss, and 29% of survivors on a texture modified diet had not received nutritional care from an RD. Overall, 57% of those who did not see an RD said they wanted more dietetic support (access to a helpline/dietitian/additional reliable information). Of concern, 37% of survivors were following or had tried alternative, unproven dietary strategies (e.g. restrictive diets, herbal remedies, juicing or detoxes), and 32% reported avoiding specific foods, e.g. processed meat or dairy. A majority (56%) felt confused by the often conflicting nutrition information available in the media and offered by people around them. Conclusions: While nutrition is considered highly important by cancer survivors and a high proportion experience potentially serious diet-related problems including weight and muscle loss, fewer than half surveyed had access to a dietitian. Over a third had used at least one alternative dietary strategy, and over half felt confused about nutrition. Comprehensive nutritional screening and referral programmes to oncology dietitians need to be implemented in the ambulatory setting in order to identify and facilitate early management of the nutritional concerns of cancer survivors.","Affiliations 1 School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, College of Science, Engineering and Food Science, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland; Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

705,Personal growth in the transition to parenthood following recent parental loss,"Objective: Although the factors associated with personal growth (PG) in the transition to parenthood have been studied in recent years, the impact of a previous stressful event has been rarely considered. This study explores the possibility that parents who lost their own parent in the years leading up to the birth of their first child will report enhanced PG. It examines the unique and combined contribution to PG in the transition to parenthood of recent parental loss, as well as the bond with the parents, the internal resource of meaning in life, and basic demographic variables. Method: Self-report questionnaires were completed by 224 Israeli parents up to 1 year following the birth of their first child. Of these, 112 had lost one of their parents during the past 7 years and 112 had not. Results: Hierarchical regression revealed that the recent loss of a parent contributed significantly to greater PG. In addition, higher PG was associated with younger age, higher presence of meaning in life, search for meaning, and perceived maternal care, and lower paternal overprotection. Conclusions: The study extends knowledge of PG among new parents, indicating that it may be related to the parent's personal circumstances, and specifically to a previous stressful event in their lives, and their relationships with their own parents. On the practical level, understanding the consequences of parental loss for PG in the transition to parenthood can help professionals develop specially designed interventions for new parents who have recently lost a parent.

706,Risk of Recurrent Stillbirth in Subsequent Pregnancies,"Objective: To compare the prospective risk of stillbirth between women with and without a stillbirth in their first pregnancy. Methods: We conducted a cohort study using perinatal data from Finland, Malta, and Scotland. Women who had at least two singleton deliveries were included. The exposed and unexposed cohorts comprised women with a stillbirth and live birth in their first pregnancy, respectively. The risk of stillbirth in any subsequent pregnancy was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Time-to-event analyses were conducted to investigate whether first pregnancy outcome had an effect on time to or the number of pregnancies preceding subsequent stillbirth. Results: The pooled data set included 1,064,564 women, 6,288 (0.59%) with a stillbirth and 1,058,276 with a live birth in a first pregnancy. Compared with women with a live birth, women with a stillbirth in the first pregnancy were more likely to have a subsequent stillbirth (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.86-2.72). For women with more than two pregnancies, the difference in risk of subsequent stillbirth between the two groups increased with the number of subsequent pregnancies. Maternal age younger than 25 years or 40 years and older, smoking, low socioeconomic status, not having a partner, pre-existing diabetes, preeclampsia, placental abruption, or delivery of a growth-restricted neonate in a first pregnancy were independently associated with subsequent stillbirth. Compared with women with a live birth in the first pregnancy, women with a stillbirth were more likely to have another pregnancy within 1 year. The absolute risk of stillbirth in a subsequent pregnancy for women with stillbirth and live birth in a first pregnancy were 2.5% and 0.5%, respectively. Conclusion: Compared with women with a live birth in a first pregnancy, women with a stillbirth have a higher risk of subsequent stillbirth irrespective of the number and sequence of the pregnancies. Despite high relative risk, the absolute risk of recurrence was low.","Affiliation 1 Aberdeen Centre for Women's Health Research, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Aberdeen, and the Medical Statistics Team, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom; the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare Finland, Helsinki, Finland; and the Directorate for Health Information and Research, Guardamangia, Malta.","Kathleen Lamont , Neil W Scott, Mika Gissler, Miriam Gatt, Sohinee Bhattacharya",Obstet Gynecol,2022 Jan 1,"Multicenter Study,Adult,Cohort Studies,Female,Finland / epidemiology,Humans,Malta / epidemiology,Parity,Pregnancy,Proportional Hazards Models,Registries,Risk Factors,Scotland / epidemiology,Social Class,Stillbirth / epidemiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856561

Results: Themes related to nutrition and improved overall well-being, use of nutritional supplements, specific foods, links to health comorbidities and food fussiness. Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive review completed on nutritional interventions to improve sleep in people with intellectual disabilities.

However, the current literature regarding the benefit of improved nutrition on sleep in people with an intellectual disability needs to be interpreted with caution.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2 Kingston University and St Georges University, London, UK.","Lynette Harper , Ann Ooms , Irene Tuffrey Wijne ",J Appl Res Intellect Disabil,2021 Nov,"Review,Humans,Intellectual Disability*,Nutritional Status,Sleep",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34212459
708,Perceived daily sleep need and sleep debt in adolescents: associations with daily affect over school and vacation periods,"Study objectives: To describe trajectories of daily perceived sleep need and sleep debt, and examine if cumulative perceived sleep debt predicts next-day affect. Methods: Daily sleep and affect were measured over two school weeks and two vacation weeks (N = 205, 54.1% females, M ± SDage = 16.9 ± 0.87 years). Each day, participants wore actigraphs and self-reported the amount of sleep needed to function well the next day (i.e. perceived sleep need), sleep duration, and high- and low-arousal positive and negative affect (PA, NA). Cumulative perceived sleep debt was calculated as the weighted average of the difference between perceived sleep need and sleep duration over the past 3 days. Cross-lagged, multilevel models were used to test cumulative sleep debt as a predictor of next-day affect. Lagged affect, day of the week, study day, and sociodemographics were controlled. Results: Perceived sleep need was lower early in the school week, before increasing in the second half of the week. Adolescents accumulated perceived sleep debt across school days and reduced it during weekends. On weekends and vacations, adolescents self-reported meeting their sleep need, sleeping the amount, or more than the amount of sleep they perceived as needing. Higher cumulative actigraphy sleep debt predicted higher next-day high arousal NA; higher cumulative diary sleep debt predicted higher NA (regardless of arousal), and lower low arousal PA the following day. Conclusion: Adolescents experienced sustained, cumulative perceived sleep debt across school days. Weekends and vacations appeared to be opportunities for reducing sleep debt. Trajectories of sleep debt during vacation suggested recovery from school-related sleep restriction. Cumulative sleep debt was related to affect on a daily basis, highlighting the value of this measure for future research and interventions.","Affiliations 1 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. 2 Women's Mental Health Service, Royal Women's Hospital, Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.","Lin Shen , Joshua F Wiley , Bei Bei ",Sleep,2021 Dec 10,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Actigraphy,Adolescent,Affect,Female,Humans,Male,Schools,Self Report,Sleep Deprivation* / complications,Sleep*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34323993

710,Prevalence and predictors of parental depressive episodes: Results from a 15-year longitudinal study,"Background: Depression affects approximately 7.5 million parents in the United States each year. Parental depression has detrimental consequences for both the parent and the parent-child relationship. The purpose of this study was to: (1) understand the prevalence of parental depressive episodes longitudinally, (2) identify the risk and protective factors for parental depressive episodes, and (3) compare the risk and protective factors for depressive episodes among mothers and fathers. Methods: We used six waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to descriptively examine parental depression over a period of 15 years. We used logistic and fixed effects regressions to assess the association between a number of demographic, health and parenting variables and maternal and paternal depression. Results: Our sample was primarily Black (48%) and Hispanic/Latino (27%). Fathers had a slightly lower prevalence of depression compared to mothers at all waves (approximately 13% averaged across waves for fathers, compared to 18% for mothers). Factors negatively correlated with depression among mothers and fathers included: social support, employment, and better-perceived health. Factors positively associated with depression for mothers and fathers were substance misuse and having a parent with a history of depression, anxiety, or drug misuse. Limitations: Our study was unable to identify causal relationships and the directionality of the relationship between depression and other variables of interest. Conclusions: We found that parental depression is prevalent in a sample of predominantly racially minoritized parents. Addressing comorbidities and increasing social support access may help manage parental depression and ensure a healthy child development.","Affiliation 1 School of Social Work, Boston College, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02457, USA.","María Pineros-Leano , Indrani Saran , Tyrone M Parchment , Natalie Grafft ",J Affect Disord,2021 Dec 1,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Depression / epidemiology,Fathers*,Female,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Mothers*,Parenting,Parents,Prevalence",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34482057
711,Growth and nutrition in pediatric neuromuscular disorders,"Background & aims: Little is currently known about the nutrition and growth outcomes in children with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), and these are likely disease dependent. The aim of this study was to describe the range of nutritional issues in pediatric NMDs and identify similarities and differences in growth outcomes and nutritional needs in children with a variety of NMDs at different ages, with the goal of informing future services. Methods: In this cross-sectional study we collected data on growth, dietetic interventions and nutrition-related issues in 160 children who attended a multidisciplinary clinic in a tertiary children's hospital, from February to December 2019. Children with significant weakness affecting mobility before the age of 3 years were clinically grouped into 'early-onset NMDs'. Results: Across our clinic, 42.5% children had a history of chronic gastrointestinal issues, and 34.4% received dietetic care on the day of clinical visit. Children with early-onset NMDs had significantly higher prevalence of swallowing issues, gastroesophageal reflux, and vomiting, as well as higher frequency of dietetic consultations, high energy diet, swallowing assessment and tube-feeding, compared to later-onset NMDs (p < 0.05). In total, 49.2% children with NMDs had an abnormal weight, in which the prevalence of underweight (n = 24, 19.2%) was significantly higher compared to normal Australian children (8.2%) (p < 0.05). In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, over 50% children were overweight/obese. Conclusion: Among children with NMDs, there were many disease-specific nutrition-related symptoms, growth issues, and dietetic practices that were tailored to individual needs. Future studies should focus on measuring the impact of specific dietetic practices on growth and nutritional outcomes, as well as developing a precision medicine approach tailored to the individual nutritional needs of children with NMDs.","Affiliations 1 Discipline of Pediatrics, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Medicine, UNSW Sydney, NSW, 2031, Australia.

712,Sleep scoring based on video-electroencephalography monitoring in an Epileptology Unit: Comparison with polysomnography,"The aim of the study was to compare the performance of video- electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring and standard polysomnography for sleep scoring in an Epileptology Unit. We calculated the level of agreement between two methods of sleep scoring, using either 27-electrode video-EEG or polysomnography for 1 night in 22 patients admitted to our Epileptology Unit. Independent experts manually scored sleep using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2017 guidelines. We evaluated the number of sleep cycles and their distribution on hypnogram, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep and rapid eye movement sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep-onset, and sleep stages. We then extracted sub-samples of recordings to examine the agreement in microarousal and rapid eye movement scoring. We used Bland and Altman plots and Cohen's kappa test to measure agreement. Bland and Altman plots showed at least 95% agreement for all studied sleep parameters with the exception of wake after sleep onset, where there was an 11 min difference. Cohen's kappa test showed an agreement for the recognition of microarousal (0.89) and of rapid eye movements (0.96) in sub-samples. Video-EEG represents an acceptable alternative tool for sleep architecture study in patients admitted to an Epileptology Unit.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière-Charles Foix, Paris, France. 2 Epileptology Unit, DMU Neuroscience 6, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière-Charles Foix, Paris, France. 3 Rehabilitation Unit, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière-Charles Foix, Paris, France. 4 Sorbonne Université, Paris, France. 5 Sleep Disorder Unit, AP-HP, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière-Charles Foix, Paris, France. 6 Public Health Department and Clinical Neurophysiology Unit, AP-HP, Hôpital Tenon, Paris, France. 7 Institut du Cerveau-Paris Brain Institute-ICM, Inserm, CNRS, Paris, France.","Vi-Huong Nguyen-Michel , Bastien Herlin , Ana Gales , Soraia Vaz , Pierre Levy , Sophie Dupont , Claude Adam , Vincent Navarro , Valerio Frazzini ",J Sleep Res,2021 Oct,"Electroencephalography*,Humans,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Stages*,Sleep, REM",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33825252
713,Effects of A Parenting-Focused Mindfulness Intervention on Adolescent Substance Use and Psychopathology: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Substance use and psychopathology symptoms increase in adolescence. One key risk factor for these is high parent stress. Mindfulness interventions reduce stress in adults and may be useful to reduce parent stress and prevent substance use (SU) and psychopathology in adolescents. This study tested the feasibility and effects of a mindfulness intervention for parents on adolescent SU and psychopathology symptoms. Ninety-six mothers of 11-17 year olds were randomly assigned to a mindfulness intervention for parents (the Parenting Mindfully [PM] intervention) or a brief parent education [PE] control group. At pre-intervention, post-intervention, 6-month follow-up, and 1-year follow-up, adolescents reported on SU and mothers and adolescents reported on adolescent externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Primary intent to treat analyses found that the PM intervention prevented increases in adolescent SU over time, relative to the PE control group. The PM intervention also prevented increases in mother-reported externalizing symptoms over time relative to the PE control group. However, PM did not have a significant effect on internalizing symptoms. PM had an indirect effect on adolescent-reported externalizing symptoms through greater mother mindfulness levels at post-intervention, suggesting mother mindfulness as a potential intervention mechanism. Notably, while mothers reported high satisfaction with PM, intervention attendance was low (31% of mothers attended zero sessions). Secondary analyses with mothers who attended > = 50% of the interventions (n = 48) found significant PM effects on externalizing symptoms, but not SU. Overall, findings support mindfulness training for parents as a promising intervention and future studies should work to promote accessibility for stressed parents.Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT02038231; Date of Registration: January 13, 2014.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA. tchaplin@gmu.edu. 2 Department of Psychology, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA. 3 Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC, USA. 4 Psychology Department, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA. 5 Inova Kellar Center, Fairfax, VA, USA. 6 Oxford Mindfulness Center, University of Oxford, Oxford, England. 7 Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.","Tara M Chaplin , Kelsey L Mauro , Timothy W Curby , Claire Niehaus , Sarah Fischer , Caitlin C Turpyn , Alexandra M Martelli , Adam Bryant Miller , Richard N Leichtweis , Ruth Baer , Rajita Sinha ",Res Child Adolesc Psychopathol,2021 Jul,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adolescent,Adult,Female,Humans,Mindfulness*,Mothers,Parenting,Parents,Substance-Related Disorders*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33620662
714,The association between REM sleep and decision-making: Supporting evidences,"Studies suggest that REM sleep is important for the maintenance of prefrontal cortex functioning. Therefore, reducing REM sleep may have an impact on cognitive functions such as impulse control and decision-making processes. This study examined the association between impulsiveness and sensation seeking personality traits, REM sleep and performance on a decision-making computer task following a habitual night of sleep and a partial sleep deprivation (PSD) condition with advanced wake-up time. Eighteen young adults participated in two experimental conditions: a control (habitual bedtime and wake time) and a 50% PSD with an advanced wake time. Impulsiveness and sensation seeking personality traits were measured with a personality inventory (NEO-PI-3), sleep was assessed using standard polysomnography and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was completed at noon following each sleep condition. Results showed that when sleep deprived, participants choose more often to play riskier decks of cards during the last half of the IGT. Results also showed that REM sleep duration and REM sleep deprivation were associated with riskier decisions on the IGT. Moreover, impulsiveness was associated with riskier decisions after a normal night of sleep. These findings suggest that REM sleep duration and impulsiveness are important factors to consider while investigating decision-making processes under conditions of uncertainty and risk.","Affiliations 1 Laboratoire du Sommeil, Département de Psychoéducation et de Psychologie, Université du Québec en Outaouais, Gatineau, Canada, J8X 3X7. 2 Behavioral and Metabolic Research Unit, School of Human Kinetics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada, K1N 6N5. 3 Laboratoire du Sommeil, Département de Psychoéducation et de Psychologie, Université du Québec en Outaouais, Gatineau, Canada, J8X 3X7.

715,Theta-gamma coupling during REM sleep depends on breathing rate,"Temporal coupling between theta and gamma oscillations is a hallmark activity pattern of several cortical networks and becomes especially prominent during REM sleep. In a parallel approach, nasal breathing has been recently shown to generate phase-entrained network oscillations which also modulate gamma. Both slow rhythms (theta and respiration-entrained oscillations) have been suggested to aid large-scale integration but they differ in frequency, display low coherence, and modulate different gamma sub-bands. Respiration and theta are therefore believed to be largely independent. In the present work, however, we report an unexpected but robust relation between theta-gamma coupling and respiration in mice. Interestingly, this relation takes place not through the phase of individual respiration cycles, but through respiration rate: the strength of theta-gamma coupling exhibits an inverted V-shaped dependence on breathing rate, leading to maximal coupling at breathing frequencies of 4-6 Hz. Noteworthy, when subdividing sleep epochs into phasic and tonic REM patterns, we find that breathing differentially relates to theta-gamma coupling in each state, providing new evidence for their physiological distinctiveness. Altogether, our results reveal that breathing correlates with brain activity not only through phase-entrainment but also through rate-dependent relations with theta-gamma coupling. Thus, the link between respiration and other patterns of cortical network activity is more complex than previously assumed.","Affiliations 1 Institute for Physiology and Pathophysiology, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany. 2 Department of General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany. 3 Brain Institute, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil.","Maximilian Hammer , Chrysovalandis Schwale , Jurij Brankačk , Andreas Draguhn , Adriano B L Tort ",Sleep,2021 Dec 10,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Mice,Respiration,Respiratory Rate,Sleep / physiology,Sleep, REM* / physiology,Theta Rhythm* / physiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34297128

717,Parental Self-Efficacy Predicted by Parents' Subjective Well-Being and Their Parenting Styles with Possible Role of Help-Seeking Orientation from Teachers,"The current study aims to test the ideas that parental self-efficacy is associated with parenting style, parents' help-seeking orientation from teachers, and subjective well-being. Based on the literature background presented, two hypotheses were examined: First, autonomy help-seeking orientation, the authoritative parenting style, and high subjective well-being would be positive predictors of parental self-efficacy. Second, dependent help-seeking orientation and non-authoritative parenting styles are negative predictors of parental self-efficacy. One hundred and thirty-two parents of school-age children answered questionnaires measuring the research and background variables. A multivariate regression analysis found that the independent variables explain about 53% of the variance of the parental self-efficacy scores, with subjective well-being and the authoritative parenting style being uniquely associated with high parental self-efficacy, and the permissive parenting style being uniquely associated with low parental self-efficacy. The present study focuses on parental self-efficacy as an important parental component, demonstrating the personal characteristics of parents that may affect their perceived efficacy, and offers an integrative portrait of factors that can describe parents' attitudes and behavior toward their competence as parents.

The Multidimensional Assessment of Parenting Scale (MAPS) is a new measure that aims to address gaps in the literature on existing self-report parenting measures. Research to date on the MAPS includes essential steps of scale development and validation; however, replicating scale dimensionality and examining differential item functioning (DIF) based on child age and a parent or child gender is a critical next step. The current study included 1,790 mothers and fathers of sons and daughters, spanning childhood to adolescence in the United States. Item response theory (IRT) confirmed initial factor-analytic work revealing positive and negative dimensions; however, the best-fitting multidimensional model included six nested dimensions from the original seven. A few notable items displayed DIF based on child age and parent gender; however, DIF based on child gender had minimal impact on the overall score.

719,Are parental changes related to improvements in preschool children's disruptive behaviours?,"Objective: To investigate whether changes in parenting after behavioural parent training in routine clinical care are associated with improvements in preschool children's disruptive behaviours. Method: We evaluated changes after parent training in maternal and paternal self-reports of parental discipline practices parenting sense of competence, and parents' ratings of child disruptive behaviours in parents of 63 children, with a one group pretest-posttest design. We also compared parenting parameters in this clinical sample with a nonclinical sample (n = 121). Results: Mothers' self-reports of parental discipline practices and parenting sense of competence significantly improved after behavioural parent training. Less over-reactivity in both mothers and fathers was associated with fewer disruptive behaviours in children. After parent training, mothers' ratings of their discipline techniques did not differ anymore from those in the nonclinical sample. Conclusion: Positive changes in parental discipline practices, particularly less over-reactive parental behaviours, were related to a decrease of disruptive child behaviours.","Affiliations 1 Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. 2 Department of Clinical Psychology and Experimental Psychopathology, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.","Lianne van der Veen-Mulders , Pieter J Hoekstra , Maaike H Nauta , Barbara J van den Hoofdakker ",Clin Psychol Psychother,2020 Jan,"Adult,Child Behavior / psychology,Child Behavior Disorders / psychology*,Child, Preschool,Fathers / psychology,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Mothers / psychology,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / education*,Parents / psychology*,Self Report,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31614051

721,RobustSleepNet: Transfer Learning for Automated Sleep Staging at Scale,"Sleep disorder diagnosis relies on the analysis of polysomnography (PSG) records. As a preliminary step of this examination, sleep stages are systematically determined. In practice, sleep stage classification relies on the visual inspection of 30-second epochs of polysomnography signals. Numerous automatic approaches have been developed to replace this tedious and expensive task. Although these methods demonstrated better performance than human sleep experts on specific datasets, they remain largely unused in sleep clinics. The main reason is that each sleep clinic uses a specific PSG montage that most automatic approaches cannot handle out-of-the-box. Moreover, even when the PSG montage is compatible, publications have shown that automatic approaches perform poorly on unseen data with different demographics. To address these issues, we introduce RobustSleepNet, a deep learning model for automatic sleep stage classification able to handle arbitrary PSG montages. We trained and evaluated this model in a leave-one-out-dataset fashion on a large corpus of 8 heterogeneous sleep staging datasets to make it robust to demographic changes. When evaluated on an unseen dataset, RobustSleepNet reaches 97% of the F1 of a model explicitly trained on this dataset. Hence, RobustSleepNet unlocks the possibility to perform high-quality out-of-the-box automatic sleep staging with any clinical setup. We further show that finetuning RobustSleepNet, using a part of the unseen dataset, increases the F1 by 2% when compared to a model trained specifically for this dataset. Therefore, finetuning might be used to reach a state-of-the-art level of performance on a specific population.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Antoine Guillot, Valentin Thorey",IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng,2021,"Electroencephalography*,Humans,Machine Learning,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Stages*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34288872
722,Personalized nutrition approach in pediatrics: a narrative review,"Dietary habits represent the main determinant of health. Although extensive research has been conducted to modify unhealthy dietary behaviors across the lifespan, obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities are increasingly observed worldwide. Individually tailored interventions are nowadays considered a promising frontier for nutritional research. In this narrative review, the technologies of importance in a pediatric clinical setting are discussed. The first determinant of the dietary balance is represented by energy intakes matching individual needs. Most emerging studies highlight the opportunity to reconsider the widely used prediction equations of resting energy expenditure. Artificial Neural Network approaches may help to disentangle the role of single contributors to energy expenditure. Artificial intelligence is also useful in the prediction of the glycemic response, based on the individual microbiome. Other factors further concurring to define individually tailored nutritional needs are metabolomics and nutrigenomic. Since most available data come from studies in adult groups, new efforts should now be addressed to integrate all these aspects to develop comprehensive and-above all-effective interventions for children. IMPACT: Personalized dietary advice, specific to individuals, should be more effective in the prevention of chronic diseases than general recommendations about diet. Artificial Neural Networks algorithms are technologies of importance in a pediatric setting that may help practitioners to provide personalized nutrition. Other approaches to personalized nutrition, while promising in adults and for basic research, are still far from practical application in pediatrics.","Affiliations 1 Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, 20122, Milan, Italy. 2 Pediatric Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122, Milan, Italy. 3 Unit of Human Nutrition and Health, Department of Food Safety Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161, Rome, Italy. 4 Pediatric Intermediate Care Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122, Milan, Italy. 5 Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, 20122, Milan, Italy. valentina.decosmi@unimi.it. 6 Pediatric Intermediate Care Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122, Milan, Italy. valentina.decosmi@unimi.it.","Gregorio P Milani , Marco Silano , Alessandra Mazzocchi , Silvia Bettocchi , Valentina De Cosmi , Carlo Agostoni ",Pediatr Res,2021 Jan,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Child,Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena*,Diet* / adverse effects,Energy Intake,Energy Metabolism,Feeding Behavior,Humans,Machine Learning,Metabolomics,Neural Networks, Computer,Nutrigenomics,Nutrition Therapy*,Nutritional Status,Nutritive Value,Pediatric Obesity / epidemiology,Pediatric Obesity / physiopathology,Pediatric Obesity / prevention & control*,Pediatrics*,Precision Medicine*,Therapy, Computer-Assisted",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230198

The article presents the key aspects of Malaysian society and the potential influence on the provision and delivery of sexual and reproductive health information and treatment to unmarried Malaysian adolescents that can be a reference for healthcare professionals especially school health nurses. The article also describes the establishment of sheltered homes, baby hatches and unregulated adoption processes as the initiatives being taken to address the issue of unintended teenage pregnancies. This article suggests that the policy and laws that require parental consent for accessing the services need to be reviewed and revised to ensure that specific services are available to adolescents in a safe environment that maintains confidentiality.","Affiliations 1 Kulliyyah of Nursing, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan, Malaysia. 2 Division of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Works, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.","Abdul Hamid Siti Hazariah , Debbie Fallon , Peter Callery ",Compr Child Adolesc Nurs,2021 Jun,"Adolescent,Contraception,Female,Humans,Malaysia,Pregnancy,Pregnancy in Adolescence*,Reproductive Health Services*,Sexual Behavior",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32442024
724,Awareness and perceptions of nutrition support in upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery: A national survey of multidisciplinary clinicians,"Background: Patients undergoing surgery for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer are at high risk of malnutrition, and a multidisciplinary approach to management is recommended. This study aimed to determine practices, awareness and perceptions of multi-disciplinary clinicians with regards to malnutrition screening and provision of nutrition support. Methods: A national survey of dietitians, surgeons, oncologists and nurses was conducted using a 30-item online REDCap survey, including questions regarding self-reported malnutrition screening/nutrition support practices, awareness and perceptions, and barriers and enablers. The survey was distributed via professional organisations/networks between 1st September and 30th November 2020. Results are presented as counts and percentages. Results: There were 130 participants (56% dietitians, 25% surgeons, 11% nurses, 8% oncologists). The majority reported that dietitians and nurses performed malnutrition screening, and dietitians and surgeons prescribed nutrition support. Most participants reported that their health service had dietetics support available overall (98%), however only 41% reported having an outpatient service. Participants (>90%) demonstrated very high awareness of the significance of malnutrition and the importance of early nutrition support. Participants mostly perceived dietitians, nurses and surgeons to be responsible for malnutrition screening, whilst responsibility of prescription of nutrition support was mostly dietitians and surgeons. There were a higher number of barriers for the outpatient setting (48%) than the inpatient setting (38%). Conclusions: Participants identified a high awareness of the importance of identification and treatment of malnutrition in UGI cancer surgery. However reported practices varied and appear to be lacking in the outpatient setting, with significant barriers identified to providing optimal nutrition care.","Affiliations 1 Department of Surgery, Western Precinct, Melbourne Medical School, The University of Melbourne, St Albans, VIC 3021, Australia; Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Western Health, Footscray, VIC 3011, Australia.

This concept covers 3 aspects: 1) irregularity of energy intake in meals (varying amounts of energy intake throughout the day and at different times from one day to the next), 2) frequency (number of meals per day), and 3) timing of food intake (actual time of day). A narrative review was conducted to identify literature evaluating the effect of personality on chrono-nutrition and subsequently obesity and cardiometabolic health. The search focused on research published since 2000 in MEDLINE using the search terms ""personality,"" ""chrono-nutrition,"" ""cardiometabolic,"" ""BMI,"" ""obesity,"" and ""metabolic rate."" Findings indicate an inverse relation between conscientiousness and obesity, with people who are more conscientious having a lower risk of obesity. Furthermore, time of day of energy intake has been linked to obesity, since meals consumed in the evening have been associated with lower resting metabolic rate. Inconsistent timing and frequency of meals have also been linked to increased body weight and worse cardiometabolic health. Together, the data indicate that eating meals at the same time every day at regular intervals might be the reason why those who score high in conscientiousness are able to maintain a healthier weight. Despite the reviewed observational evidence, there is an apparent gap in the existing literature on the interplay between personality, chrono-nutrition, and obesity and particularly on how dietary interventions should be designed considering different personality traits. Future research is needed to clarify this association and how it interacts with other factors, thus elucidating the role of chrono-nutrition in health.","Affiliations 1 Human Nutrition Department, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar. 2 Department of Life and Health Sciences, School of Sciences and Engineering, University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus. 3 Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus. 4 Department of Nutritional Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.","Tamara Al Abdi , Eleni Andreou , Alexia Papageorgiou , Alexandros Heraclides , Elena Philippou ",Adv Nutr,2020 Sep 1,"Review,Cardiovascular Diseases* / etiology,Circadian Rhythm,Energy Intake,Feeding Behavior*,Humans,Meals,Nutritional Status,Personality",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32407537
726,Fathers of Young Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing Children: A Systematic Review,"Much of the literature exploring the role of parents of children who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) has focused on mothers; yet, the involvement and perspectives of fathers is valuable and warrants attention. Following the PRISMA guidelines, this systematic literature review examined the peer-reviewed research that has differentially explored the experiences of fathers and mothers of young DHH children. Utilizing three databases (Web of Science, PsychINFO, Scopus) and spanning 50 years (1969-2019), 457 non-duplicated articles were identified that included the fathers of DHH children, birth to six years. Independent review of the titles, abstracts, and keywords by the authors limited these to 119. Full manuscripts were assessed for eligibility; 37 were deemed appropriate for inclusion in this systematic review. The papers included have been organized into the following themes: perspectives on parenting, parental stress and coping, parent-child interaction, involvement in early intervention, parental self-efficacy, and benefits of fathers' inclusion. Recommendations for future research include: (a) actively recruiting fathers in research, (b) differentially analyzing fathers' and mothers' experiences in research studies, (c) using information gleaned from research regarding father-child and mother-child interactions to guide interventions/programming, (d) recognizing the bidirectional influences of fathers and their DHH children, (e) moving beyond descriptive studies to explore fathers' influences on child outcomes, and (f) recognizing diverse family constellations.","Affiliations 1 Children's Center for Communication/Beverly School for the Deaf (CCCBSD). 2 Division of Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital. 3 Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School. 4 Dutch Foundation for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Child. 5 Department of Psychology, Utrecht University.","Amy Szarkowski , Evelien Dirks ",J Deaf Stud Deaf Educ,2021 Mar 17,"Systematic Review,Female,Hearing,Humans,Mothers*,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33454727
727,Parenting practices and dysregulation profile in a sample of Italian children,"Background: emotional dysregulation is a transdiagnostic factor linked to a heightened risk for psychopathology. A dysregulation profile (DP) derived from the Strenght and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is often used to indirectly assess emotional dysregulation in children and adolescents. Theoretical models account for parenting as a causal and maintaining factor for emotional dysregulation. Notwithstanding, empirical data are scant. Methods: 547 students (47.5% males) aged between 9 and 11 years of age (mean age = 9.66, SD = 0.64) were assessed with the SDQ-DP (teacher and parent-reported) and their parents self-reported on their own parenting practices with the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire. Results: as expected, SDQ-DP teacher-rated was positively associated with maternal and paternal negative parenting practices; SDQ-DP mother and father-rated were both negatively associated with maternal and paternal positive parenting and positively associated with maternal and paternal negative parenting practices. Limitation: the age range is limited to pre-adolescents. The cross-sectional nature of the study precludes inferences on causality. Conclusions: youth's emotional dysregulation is linked to parenting practices. These findings support the need to include families in the intervention for emotionally dysregulated youths.","Affiliations 1 IRCCS Stella Maris, Scientific Institute of Child Neurology and Psychiatry, Viale del Tirreno 331 Calambrone, Pisa 56018, Italy.

728,Optimising protein intake in older people to maintain their musculoskeletal health,"The concept of healthy ageing has become a significant aspect of the public health approach to older people's well-being. Physiological changes that occur with ageing, such as a lack of mobility and sarcopenia (an age-related decline in muscle mass and strength), have the potential to negatively affect older people's quality of life and musculoskeletal health, often contributing to falls and fractures. Protein intake is a crucial element in maintaining optimal health in older people, and is important in delaying sarcopenia. This article discusses the role of protein in healthy ageing and outlines various recommendations for optimising protein intake in older people.","Affiliations 1 University of Roehampton, London, England, and UK representative for FrieslandCampina Institute. 2 Life Sciences Department, University of Roehampton, London, England.","Karen Reid , Sue Reeves ",Nurs Stand,2021 Aug 4,"Aged,Aging,Humans,Muscle, Skeletal / physiology,Nutritional Status,Quality of Life,Sarcopenia* / pathology,Sarcopenia* / prevention & control",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34308582

730,Effectiveness of the Close Collaboration with Parents intervention on parent-infant closeness in NICU,"Background: Parent-infant closeness during hospital care of newborns has many benefits for both infants and parents. We developed an educational intervention for neonatal staff, Close Collaboration with Parents, to increase parent-infant closeness during hospital care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on parent-infant closeness in nine hospitals in Finland. Methods: Parents of hospitalized infants were recruited in the hospitals during 3-month periods before and after the Close Collaboration with Parents intervention. The data were collected using daily Closeness diaries. Mothers and fathers separately filled in the time they spent in the hospital and the time of skin-to-skin contact with their infant during each hospital care day until discharge. Statistical analyses were done using a linear model with covariates. Results: Diaries were kept before and after the intervention by a total of 170 and 129 mothers and 126 and 84 fathers, respectively. Either parent was present on average 453 min per day before the intervention and 620 min after the intervention in the neonatal unit. In the adjusted model, the increase was 99 min per day (p = 0.0007). The infants were in skin-to-skin contact on average 76 min per day before the intervention and 114 min after the intervention. In the adjusted model, skin-to-skin contact increased by 24 min per day (p = 0.0405). Conclusion: The Close Collaboration with Parents intervention increased parents' presence and skin-to-skin contact in nine hospitals. This study suggests that parent-infant closeness may be one mediating factor explaining benefits of parenting interventions. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04635150 .

731,"Autism-specific parenting self-efficacy: An examination of the role of parent-reported intervention involvement, satisfaction with intervention-related training, and caregiver burden","What is already known about the topic?Parents of children with autism experience enormous challenges managing the complex needs of caring for their children. This includes coordinating multiple and complex therapies and acting as partners in treatment. Parenting self-efficacy is the confidence a person has in their ability to manage the tasks that are part of raising a child. People who have more confidence, or greater parenting self-efficacy, often feel less stressed and are more able to manage the demands of family life. This is particularly important for parents with children who have autism spectrum disorder, since they experience more parenting pressures. Although a lot is known about parenting self-efficacy in parents of neurotypical children, we do not know enough about how to help parents of children with autism spectrum disorder develop greater parenting self-efficacy.What this paper adds?This study shows that parents gain a greater sense of parenting self-efficacy when they feel more involved in their child's therapy and are more satisfied with the training they receive as part of these therapies. We also find that feeling pressure related to being a caregiver of a child with autism spectrum disorder can undermine autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. However, parents' sense of confidence was not limited by the severity of their child's symptoms.Implications for practice, research, or policyThe results suggest that there is an opportunity to help parents develop a greater sense of confidence in their ability to manage the complexities of raising a child with autism spectrum disorder by helping them feel more involved in treatment and by creating intervention-related training experiences that are more satisfying. Providers might also help by taking time to address the challenges and pressures that parents are experiencing, and helping them find ways to deal with these challenges. We suggest that there needs to be more research exploring how providers can best design interventions that support autism-specific parenting self-efficacy as a way of improving parental and child well-being.","Affiliation 1 Emerson College, USA.","Jennifer Kurzrok , Eileen McBride , Ruth B Grossman ",Autism,2021 Jul,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Autism Spectrum Disorder* / therapy,Autistic Disorder* / therapy,Caregiver Burden,Child,Humans,Parenting,Parents,Personal Satisfaction",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33858217
732,"Perceived Child Difficultness, Emotion Dysregulation, and Emotion-Related Parenting among Chinese Parents","This study investigated the integrative effects of parents' perceptions of child difficultness and parental emotion dysregulation on emotion-related parenting among a group of Chinese parents of school-age children. One hundred and fifty parent-child dyads (121 biological mothers and 29 biological fathers as primary caregivers; Mage = 39.22 years) from urban Beijing, China participated in the study. Parents reported on their own emotion dysregulation and their children's difficultness, as well as their emotion socialization practices. Children (Mage = 8.54 years; ranged from 6 to 12 years) reported on their parents' use of psychological control strategies. Main and interactive effects were tested using path analysis. Results indicated that parents' perceived child difficultness was negatively associated with supportive reactions to children's expression of negative emotions, and parental emotion dysregulation was positively associated with unsupportive reactions. When parents perceived their children to be difficult and also reported emotion regulation difficulties of their own, they showed the highest levels of psychological control (child reports). These findings suggest differential effects of parent cognition and emotion on supportive and unsupportive reactions to children's negative emotions. Both cognition and emotion play important roles in relation to parents' use of psychological control.","Affiliations 1 Division of Arts and Sciences, NYU Shanghai, Shanghai, China. 2 NYU-ECNU Institute for Social Development at NYU Shanghai, Shanghai, China. 3 Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA. 4 Beijing Key Laboratory of Applied Experimental Psychology, National Demonstration Center for Experimental Psychology Education, Faculty of Psychology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.","Lixian Cui , Xutong Zhang , Zhuo Rachel Han ",Fam Process,2021 Dec,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Child,Emotions,Female,Humans,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting*,Parents,Socialization",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33544435

734,Sleep in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Patients During Critical and Acute Care,"Background: Nurses caring for intensive care patients diagnosed with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) conduct frequent neurological assessments and vital signs over an extended period during which patients are at risk of vasospasm. The frequency of assessments can negatively impact sleep, resulting in altered thought processes and mood, including delirium. There are 2 types of sleep during the night: non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and REM sleep (also called stage R). Non-REM sleep is subdivided into 3 stages: stage N1, stage N2, and stage N3. These 4 stages of sleep are referred to as sleep architecture. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore patterns of sleep in patients with aSAH over time during hospitalization. Methods: Sleep data of stages and cycles were collected with use of a Fitbit activity tracker in this pilot, exploratory research study. Demographic data included age and gender. Six English-speaking patients, diagnosed with an aneurysmal SAH, confirmed by diagnostic angiogram, were followed in neuro-intensive care unit (ICU), neuro-step-down, neuroscience unit, and inpatient rehabilitation. Results: There were a total of 226 sleep events. A sleep event encompassed a recorded start and end time on a single date. Each event included several sleep cycles. Each sleep cycle consisted of wakefulness, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. In 79 sleep events, light and deep sleep did add up to more than 4 hours; only 38 sleep events indicated more than 90 minutes of REM/night; 61 events showed the cycle of light-deep-light-REM cycles; 80 events showed 3 to 5 REM periods/night; and only 46 events demonstrated that the early-morning REM cycle was the longest. The average number of REM cycles increased from ICU (n = 4.6) to rehabilitation (n = 6.5). The percentage of days with sleep cycles also increased from ICU to rehabilitation (42 to 64). Discussion: ""Normal"" sleep patterns are disrupted in aSAH patients throughout their hospitalization. Data in this study revealed that the patients do sleep; however, it is rarely organized. Patients were not always able to progress through the expected sleep cycle of light to deep to light to REM. Hospitalized aSAH patients do engage in REM sleep, but its pattern is abnormal. Staff should strategize on minimizing interruptions, clustering care, and minimizing sounds. Nurses should advocate for the frequency of assessments and vital signs based on hospital/unit policy and individual patient needs.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Susan B Fowler, Sarah Walker, Timothy W Jones, Lauren Gell",Dimens Crit Care Nurs,2021 Mar-Apr,"Critical Care,Humans,Sleep,Sleep Stages,Sleep, REM,Subarachnoid Hemorrhage*,Wakefulness",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33961379
735,Self-Reported and Objective Sleep Measures in Stroke Survivors With Incomplete Motor Recovery at the Chronic Stage,"Background. Stroke survivors commonly complain of difficulty sleeping. Poor sleep is associated with reduced quality of life and more understanding of long-term consequences of stroke on sleep is needed. Objective. The primary aims were to (1) compare sleep measures between chronic stroke survivors and healthy controls and (2) test for a relationship between motor impairment, time since stroke and sleep. Secondary aims were to explore mood and inactivity as potential correlates of sleep and test the correlation between self-reported and objective sleep measures. Methods. Cross-sectional sleep measures were obtained for 69 chronic stroke survivors (mean 65 months post-stroke, 63 years old, 24 female) and 63 healthy controls (mean 61 years old, 27 female). Self-reported sleep was assessed with the sleep condition indicator (SCI) and sleep diary ratings, objective sleep with 7-nights actigraphy and mood with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Upper extremity motor impairment was assessed with the Fugl-Meyer assessment. Results. Stroke survivors had significantly poorer SCI score (P < .001) and higher wake after sleep onset (P = .005) than controls. Neither motor impairment, nor time since stroke, explained significant variance in sleep measures for the stroke group. For all participants together, greater depression was associated with poorer SCI score (R2adj = .197, P < .001) and higher age with more fragmented sleep (R2adj = .108, P < .001). There were weak correlations between nightly sleep ratings and actigraphy sleep measures (rs = .15-.24). Conclusions. Sleep disturbance is present long-term after stroke. Depressive symptoms may present a modifiable factor which should be investigated alongside techniques to improve sleep in this population.","Affiliations 1 Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, FMRIB, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, 6396University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. 2 552380NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, UK. 3 212787Oxford Centre for Enablement, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK. 4 Department of Experimental Psychology, 6396University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.","Melanie K Fleming , Tom Smejka , David Henderson Slater , Evangeline Grace Chiu , Nele Demeyere , Heidi Johansen-Berg ",Neurorehabil Neural Repair,2021 Oct,"Observational Study,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Prospective Studies,Recovery of Function / physiology*,Self Report,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Deprivation / complications,Sleep Deprivation / physiopathology*,Stroke / complications,Stroke / physiopathology*,Survivors",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34196598
736,The impact of antiseizure medications on polysomnographic parameters: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Oral antiseizure medications (ASMs) are first-line treatments for patients with epilepsy. However, ASMs may alter sleep architecture, adversely affecting patient outcomes. The meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the effect of ASMs on sleep architecture. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central database (up to Febrary 2021) were searched for randomized control trials (RCT) with effects of ASMs on polysomnography parameters. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed. We did not set limitation to the participants with underlying diagnosis of epilepsy. Results: Eighteen randomized-controlled trials fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The effects of five main groups of ASMs (sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers, GABA enhancers, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A [SV2A] ligand, and broad-spetrum ASMs) on slow-wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and sleep efficiency (SE) were analyzed. Compared with placebo, calcium channel blockers and GABA enhancers significantly increased SWS. GABA enhancers also decreased REM sleep percentage, whereas calcium channel blockers significantly increased SE. Sodium channel blockers, SV2A ligand and broad-spectrum ASMs did not affect SWS, REM sleep, or SE. The subgroup analysis revealed that gabapentin, pregabalin, and tiagabine increased the percentage of SWS. Tiagabine also decreased REM sleep, whereas pregabalin increased SE. Finally, levetiracetam did not affect SWS, REM sleep, and SE. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that ASMs can have a statistically significant effect on sleep parameters; the effect differs between ASMs.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Medicine,College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 2 Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 3 Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Municipal Siaogang Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 4 Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 5 Department of Neurology, Yuan's General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 6 Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Municipal Min-Sheng Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 7 Department of Psychiatry, Tri-Service General Hospital, School of Medicine, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Brain Science, National Yang-Ming Chiao-Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan. 8 Prospect Clinic for Otorhinolaryngology & Neurology, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Psychology, College of Medical and Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.

737,Nutritional Risks Among Female Athletes,"Background: Limited research studies have been conducted on nutritional risks among female athletes. Therefore, this literature review focuses on rigorously designed studies that examined nutritional risks among female athletes with further recommendations for athletes, coaches, parents, and health professionals, which would help improve the health of female athletes. Methods: This review evaluates the most recent research on nutritional risk among female athletes. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed studies of original research on human subjects 13 years of age or older; sample size of N ≥ 19; and studies with a thorough description of their sample and methods. A systematic search of the databases PubMed and Cochrane for published studies (from year 2000 to year 2019) was conducted to identify articles that met inclusion criteria. Bibliographies of identified articles were also searched for relevant articles. Results: Of the 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria, most were mainly cross-sectional in design with few rigorous controls. Findings reveal that strategies to enhance nutrition patterns among female athletes may be important to avoid risks of disordered eating, eating disorders, low energy availability, and symptoms of relative energy deficiency in sports. In addition, general nutrition knowledge is lacking among athletes, sports teams, and coaches. Conclusions: This review highlights the scarcity of evidence-based, rigorous studies examining nutritional risks among female athletes. Findings suggest that interdisciplinary working groups, comprising physicians, sports dietitians, and other supportive health professionals, would be beneficial for female athletes in helping to improve their overall diet, performance, and health.","Affiliations 1 Department of Ob/Gyn and Reproductive Sciences, Rutgers, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Cardiovascular Institute, New Brunswick, New Jersey. 2 Didactic Program in Dietetics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey. 3 Department of Ob/Gyn and Reproductive Sciences, Rutgers, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Women's Health Institute, New Brunswick, New Jersey. 4 McCosh Health Center, University Health Services Sports Nutrition Services, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey.","Mary Downes Gastrich , Virginia Quick , Gloria Bachmann , Alexa McDonald Moriarty ",J Womens Health (Larchmt),2020 May,"Systematic Review,Adolescent,Athletes*,Diet,Feeding and Eating Disorders / epidemiology*,Female,Humans,Nutritional Status*,Risk Factors,Sports,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040354
738,Relationship between parenthood and cortical thickness in late adulthood,"Pregnancy and the early postpartum period alter the structure of the brain; particularly in regions related to parental care. However, the enduring effects of this period on human brain structure and cognition in late life is unknown. Here we use magnetic resonance imaging to examine differences in cortical thickness related to parenthood in late life, for both sexes. In 235 healthy older women, we find a positive relationship between parity (number of children parented) and memory performance in mothers. Parity was also associated with differences in cortical thickness in women in the parahippocampus, precuneus, cuneus and pericalcarine sulcus. We also compared non-parents to parents of one child, in a sub-sample of older women (N = 45) and men (N = 35). For females, six regions differed in cortical thickness between parents and non-parents; these regions were consistent with those seen earlier in life in previous studies. For males, five regions differed in cortical thickness between parents and non-parents. We are first to reveal parenthood-related brain differences in late-life; our results are consistent with previously identified areas that are altered during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that neural changes associated with early stages of parenthood persist into older age, and for women, may be related to marginally better cognitive outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. 2 Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. 3 Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Integrative Brain Function, Australia. 4 Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. 5 Department of Neuroscience (Medicine), Monash University, Alfred Hospital Campus, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.","Edwina R Orchard , Phillip G D Ward , Francesco Sforazzini , Elsdon Storey , Gary F Egan , Sharna D Jamadar ",PLoS One,2020 Jul 28,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cerebral Cortex / anatomy & histology*,Cerebral Cortex / physiology*,Child,Female,Humans,Male,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*,Pregnancy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32722686

We begin by emphasizing the causal role of the body in dream generation, and describe a circuitry between the sleeping body and the dreaming mind. We suggest that nearly any sensory stimuli has potential for modulating experience in sleep. Considering other areas that might afford tools for engineering sensory content in simulated worlds, we turn to Virtual Reality (VR). We outline a collection of relevant VR technologies, including devices engineered to stimulate haptic, temperature, vestibular, olfactory, and auditory sensations. We believe these technologies, which have been developed for high mobility and low cost, can be translated to the field of dream engineering. We close by discussing possible future directions in this field and the ethics of a world in which targeted dream direction and sleep manipulation are feasible.","Affiliations 1 Sleep & Neurophysiology Research Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.

741,"Sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep duration: a national comparative study of university students in Jordan","Background: Sleep problems have significant negative health consequences on university students. Study aim: To assess subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep duration in a national sample of university students and investigate differences in these components with selected variables. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis and multi-stage sampling were conducted to select a sample of 1308 students from three major areas in Jordan. Sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep duration were measured by an Arabic version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were analyzed using measures of frequency and central tendency and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Two-thirds of university students described their sleep quality as fairly bad and very bad and 20 reported sleep latency of more than 30 min during the past month. There was a significant difference in subjective sleep quality according to the student's place of residence. Sleep latency differed according to students' income, physical activity, use of media devices before sleep, smoking status, and academic achievement. Significant differences were also found in sleep duration with students' academic achievement, academic level, and body mass index. Conclusions: University students suffer from poor sleep quality, delayed sleep phase, and sleep deprivation. Lower-income, smoking, physical inactivity, and using media devices before sleep contributed to students' sleeping problems.

It is defined as a problem with significant negative outcomes by both biomedical and epidemiological approaches. However, little is known about pregnancy during adolescence from the perspective of women who experienced this in the specific context of armed conflict and displacement. Aim: This article focuses on how internally displaced women understand their experiences of pregnancy in adolescence in the context of armed conflict through an ethnographic approach in a receptor community of internally displaced women in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods: Based on 10 years of experience in the community, we conducted 1 year of fieldwork, using an ethnographic approach. We collected life stories of 20 internally displaced women through in-depth interviews and ran 8 workshops with them and other women from the community. We used thematic analysis to analyse the responses of internally-displaced women and understand how they made meaning around their experiences of adolescent pregnancy in the context of displacement. Results: The main themes that emerged from participants' experiences include rural violence, early family life (characterized by violence and mistreatment at home), meanings of pregnancy at an early age (including being challenged and feelings of love), and reactions to their pregnancies during adolescence (such as stigmatization) from their families and partners. Conclusion: Our analysis of the in-depth interviews and the workshops suggests that adolescent pregnancy among women who are internally displaced has complex dynamics, characterized by the violent context of the rural areas, but primarily by the violence experienced during their childhood. The experience of pregnancy during adolescence brings feelings of ownership and also challenges, together with the forced displacement. This understanding will provide insights for policy makers and healthcare providers on how to work with this specific population who have experienced pregnancy in adolescence.","Affiliations 1 Research school CAPHRI, Department of Health, Ethics, and Society, Faculty of Health, Medicine, and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.

745,Reward does not facilitate visual perceptual learning until sleep occurs,"A growing body of evidence indicates that visual perceptual learning (VPL) is enhanced by reward provided during training. Another line of studies has shown that sleep following training also plays a role in facilitating VPL, an effect known as the offline performance gain of VPL. However, whether the effects of reward and sleep interact on VPL remains unclear. Here, we show that reward interacts with sleep to facilitate offline performance gains of VPL. First, we demonstrated a significantly larger offline performance gain over a 12-h interval including sleep in a reward group than that in a no-reward group. However, the offline performance gains over the 12-h interval without sleep were not significantly different with or without reward during training, indicating a crucial interaction between reward and sleep in VPL. Next, we tested whether neural activations during posttraining sleep were modulated after reward was provided during training. Reward provided during training enhanced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time, increased oscillatory activities for reward processing in the prefrontal region during REM sleep, and inhibited neural activation in the untrained region in early visual areas in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep. The offline performance gains were significantly correlated with oscillatory activities of visual processing during NREM sleep and reward processing during REM sleep in the reward group but not in the no-reward group. These results suggest that reward provided during training becomes effective during sleep, with excited reward processing sending inhibitory signals to suppress noise in visual processing, resulting in larger offline performance gains over sleep.","Affiliations 1 Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912. 2 Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912 yuka_sasaki@brown.edu.","Masako Tamaki , Aaron V Berard , Tyler Barnes-Diana , Jesse Siegel , Takeo Watanabe , Yuka Sasaki ",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,2020 Jan 14,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Adult,Female,Humans,Learning / physiology*,Male,Psychomotor Performance / physiology,Reward*,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Stages / physiology,Sleep, REM / physiology,Spatial Learning / physiology*,Visual Perception / physiology*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31892542
746,A Scoping Review of the Application of Metabolomics in Nutrition Research: The Literature Survey 2000-2019,"Nutrimetabolomics is an emerging field in nutrition research, and it is expected to play a significant role in deciphering the interaction between diet and health. Through the development of omics technology over the last two decades, the definition of food and nutrition has changed from sources of energy and major/micro-nutrients to an essential exposure factor that determines health risks. Furthermore, this new approach has enabled nutrition research to identify dietary biomarkers and to deepen the understanding of metabolic dynamics and the impacts on health risks. However, so far, candidate markers identified by metabolomics have not been clinically applied and more efforts should be made to validate those. To help nutrition researchers better understand the potential of its application, this scoping review outlined the historical transition, recent focuses, and future prospects of the new realm, based on trends in the number of human research articles from the early stage of 2000 to the present of 2019 by searching the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE). Among them, objective dietary assessment, metabolic profiling, and health risk prediction were positioned as three of the principal applications. The continued growth will enable nutrimetabolomics research to contribute to personalized nutrition in the future.","Affiliations 1 Graduate School of Health Management, Keio University, Kanagawa 252-0883, Japan. 2 Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.","Eriko Shibutami , Toru Takebayashi ",Nutrients,2021 Oct 24,"Review,Biomedical Research / trends*,Humans,Metabolomics / trends*,Nutritional Physiological Phenomena*,Nutritional Sciences / trends*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836016
747,Pregnancy and undifferentiated connective tissue disease: outcome and risk of flare in 100 pregnancies,"Objective: UCTD is a systemic autoimmune condition that fails to fulfil the criteria for a definite CTD. Given that there are a lack of studies on links between pregnancy and UCTD, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of disease flares or development of CTD in addition to the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with UCTD. Methods: This is a retrospective study using prospectively collected data for 100 pregnancies in 81 incidences of UCTD treated in a single referral centre. Results: A total of 11 pregnancies (11%) ended in miscarriage in the first trimester and the remaining 89 (89%) ended with a live birth. Thirteen patients (13%) flared during pregnancy or puerperium and three (3%) suffered major flares that led to the development of SLE with renal involvement. Obstetric complications occurred in 26 of the 89 successful pregnancies (29%), including 1 case (1%) of pre-eclampsia; in some cases, a single pregnancy was affected by more than one complication. There was a significant link between disease flare and both anti-dsDNA-positive antibodies at baseline (P < 0.01) and disease activity at the beginning of pregnancy (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The impact on pregnancy in the study's cohort appears to be less serious in UCTD than in other CTDs. Nevertheless, disease flares and obstetric complications can represent a clinical challenge and clinical and serological disease activity would appear to represent important determinants of pregnancy outcomes. Pre-pregnancy counselling and planning as well as close monitoring during pregnancy is therefore essential.","Affiliations 1 Rheumatology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Pisa. 2 Division of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa. 3 Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.","Dina Zucchi , Chiara Tani , Francesca Monacci , Elena Elefante , Linda Carli , Alice Parma , Chiara Stagnaro , Francesco Ferro , Sabrina Gori , Francesca Anna Letizia Strigini , Marta Mosca ",Rheumatology (Oxford),2020 Jun 1,"Adult,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / diagnosis*,Pregnancy Outcome*,Retrospective Studies,Severity of Illness Index,Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Diseases / diagnosis*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31593595
748,Synergistic effect of sleep depth and seizures correlates with postictal heart rate,"Our objective was to determine the effect of sleep on heart rate following a recorded seizure. We prospectively acquired heart rate data in hospitalized epilepsy monitoring unit patients. We analyzed heart rate trends for multiple seizures (n = 101) in patients (n = 42) with electroencephalographically confirmed events. The patient's sleep state was scored for the 5 min preceding each seizure and correlated with the postictal nadir heart rate (PINHR). The depth of sleep during the 5 min before a seizure correlated (correlation coefficient [CC] = -.229, p < .05) with PINHR. This result was more significant and strengthened (CC = -.272, 95% confidence interval = -.392 to -.152, p < .001) when adjusted for covariates of age, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and baseline heart rate. Sleep depth is an independent predictor of the change in heart rate following a seizure. Diminished heart rate following a seizure in the setting of sleep is likely secondary to non-rapid eye movement sleep's synergistic effect on parasympathetic tone.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. 2 Center for Advanced Medical Analytics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. 3 University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA. 4 Advanced Medical Predictive Devices, Diagnostics, and Displays, Charlottesville, VA, USA.","Andrew C Schomer , Morgan Lynch , Stephanie Lowenhaupt , Juliana Leonardo , Valentina Baljak , Matthew Clark , Jaideep Kapur , Mark Quigg ",Epilepsia,2021 May,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Female,Heart Rate / physiology*,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Seizures / physiopathology*,Sleep / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33713433

750,Nutrition Justice: Uncovering Invisible Pathways to Malnutrition,"We propose the use of the analytic frame of ""nutrition justice"" to reconcile the separate imperatives of Global Health for nutritional sufficiency for all, the requirement to eradicate childhood malnutrition, and the need for strategies to check the emerging pandemic of the double burden of malnutrition in the Global South. Malnutrition and its consequences of growth stunting are the result of disruption to the nutritional ecology of childhood from structural violence. This is mediated through loss of food security and perturbation to the cultural status of food, and on the prerequisites for nurture during infancy and early childhood. These socio-political factors obscure the role of biological adaptation to nutritional constraint on growth and hence the causal pathway to the double burden of malnutrition. In this paper we describe how the effects of historical and contemporary structural violence on the nutritional ecology of childhood are mediated using the examples of remote Aboriginal Australia and the Lao PDR. Both populations live by force of circumstance in a ""metabolic ghetto"" that has disrupted the prerequisites for parental nurturing through loss of food security and of traditional sources of transitional staple foods for weaning. Growth faltering and stunting of stature are markers of adaptation to nutritional constraint yet are also the first steps on the track to the double burden. We discuss the implications of these observations for strategies for global food sufficiency by mean of a thought-experiment of the effect of food and nutrient sufficiency for growth on future health and metabolic adaptation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine, Peter Doherty Institute of Immunity and Infection, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. 2 The Department of Anthropology, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. 3 School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.","Sarah Hanieh , Holly High , John Boulton ",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),2020 Mar 24,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Global Health*,Humans,Malnutrition / epidemiology*,Malnutrition / physiopathology*,Nutritional Physiological Phenomena*,Nutritional Status*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32265841

752,Sleep-Dependent Directional Interactions of the Central Nervous System-Cardiorespiratory Network,"Objective: We investigated the nature of interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and the cardiorespiratory system during sleep. Methods: Overnight polysomnography recordings were obtained from 33 healthy individuals. The relative spectral powers of five frequency bands, three ECG morphological features and respiratory rate were obtained from six EEG channels, ECG, and oronasal airflow, respectively. The synchronous feature series were interpolated to 1 Hz to retain the high time-resolution required to detect rapid physiological variations. CNS-cardiorespiratory interaction networks were built for each EEG channel and a directionality analysis was conducted using multivariate transfer entropy. Finally, the difference in interaction between Deep, Light, and REM sleep (DS, LS, and REM) was studied. Results: Bidirectional interactions existed in central-cardiorespiratory networks, and the dominant direction was from the cardiorespiratory system to the brain during all sleep stages. Sleep stages had evident influence on these interactions, with the strength of information transfer from heart rate and respiration rate to the brain gradually increasing with the sequence of REM, LS, and DS. Furthermore, the occipital lobe appeared to receive the most input from the cardiorespiratory system during LS. Finally, different ECG morphological features were found to be involved with various central-cardiac and cardiac-respiratory interactions. Conclusion: These findings reveal detailed information regarding CNS-cardiorespiratory interactions during sleep and provide new insights into understanding of sleep control mechanisms.

753,fMRI lag structure during waking up from early sleep stages,"The brain mechanisms by which we transition from sleep to a conscious state remain largely unknown in humans, partly because of methodological challenges. Here we study a pre-existing dataset of waking up participants originally designed for a study of dreaming (Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, & Kamitani, 2013) and suggest that suddenly awakening from early sleep stages results from a two-stage process that involves a sequence of cortical and subcortical brain activity. First, subcortical and sensorimotor structures seem to be recruited before most cortical regions, followed by fast, ignition-like whole-brain activation-with frontal regions engaging a little after the rest of the brain. Second, a comparably slower and possibly mirror-reversed stage might take place, with cortical regions activating before subcortical structures and the cerebellum. This pattern of activation points to a key role of subcortical structures for the initiation and maintenance of conscious states.","Affiliations 1 Cognitive Science Group, Instituto de Investigaciones Psicológicas, Facultad de Psicología Universidad Nacional de Córdoba - CONICET, Argentina. 2 INSERM, U 1127, F-75013 Paris, France; Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle Epinière, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, 75013 Paris, France. 3 Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR), Kyoto, Japan. 4 Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales, Universidad de Córdoba, CIEM-CONICET, Spain. 5 Latin American Brain Health (BrainLat), Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago, Chile; National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina; Cognitive Neuroscience Center (CNC), Universidad de San Andrés, Argentina; Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI), University of California San Francisco (UCSF), USA. 6 Laboratorio de Neurociencia, Universidad Torcuato Di Tella, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Facultad de Lenguas y Educación, Universidad Nebrija, Madrid, Spain. 7 Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR), Kyoto, Japan; Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. 8 Cognitive Science Group, Instituto de Investigaciones Psicológicas, Facultad de Psicología Universidad Nacional de Córdoba - CONICET, Argentina.

754,Conceptual and ethical problems underpinning calls to abandon vaginal breech birth,"The view that vaginal breech birth is unjustifiable due to neonatal safety concerns has resulted in continued calls for breech pregnancies to be managed via a policy of planned caesarean birth. Vaginal breech birth has of course always occurred, but women with term breech pregnancies who seek to have a vaginal birth often face coercive pressures to have a caesarean birth instead. In this paper I argue that even if there is population level evidence that vaginal birth is relatively riskier for the breech presenting fetus, implementing a policy of planned caesarean birth would essentially be an unjustified attempt at forced medical intervention upon women. Advocates of a policy of planned caesarean birth often conflate the acceptability of allocating participants to a treatment group (policy) within the context of a randomized controlled trial with the justifiability of doing that as part of individual health care. Calls for obstetricians to ""abandon vaginal breech birth"" mistakenly position vaginal breech birth itself as a form of medical intervention that can simply be removed as an option for women by obstetricians. In reality, abandoning vaginal breech birth would entail abandoning women by denying them access to healthcare options that are otherwise available to any woman having a vaginal birth.","Affiliation 1 School of Clinical Medicine - TPCH Northside, The University of Queensland, Rode Road, Chermside, Queensland, 4032, Australia.

755,Ruminant conceptus-maternal interactions: interferon-tau and beyond,"Embryonic or fetal loss in cattle is associated with problems that occur during oocyte maturation, early embryonic development, conceptus elongation, maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP), and/or placental attachment and implantation. Many of these problems manifest as inadequate or asynchronous communication between the developing conceptus and endometrium, resulting in pregnancy failure. This review will provide an overview of how various conceptus-endometrial paracrine signaling systems control the fate of early pregnancy in cattle and other ruminants. We begin by summarizing the actions of interferon-tau, the classic MRP signal in ruminates, and then explore how other secretory factors derived from either the conceptus or endometrium influence establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Insight into how the endometrium responds to male vs. female conceptuses or conceptuses produced by in vitro methods will also be described. Specific focus will be placed on describing how ""omic"" technologies and other cutting-edge techniques have assisted with identifying novel conceptus and/or endometrial factors and their functions. Recent findings indicate that the endometrial transcriptome and histotroph are altered by conceptus sex, quality, and origin, suggesting that the endometrium is a sensor of conceptus biochemistry. Although the endometrium has a certain level of flexibility in terms of conceptus-maternal interactions, this interplay is not sufficient to retain some pregnancies. However, new information inspires us to learn more and will help develop technologies that mitigate early embryonic loss and reproductive failure in ruminants and other animals.","Affiliations 1 Department of Animal Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA. 2 Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, USA.","Daniel J Mathew , Katie D Peterson , L Kirsten Senn , Mary A Oliver , Alan D Ealy ",J Anim Sci,2022 Jul 1,"Review,Animals,Cattle,Embryo Implantation*,Endometrium,Female,Interferon Type I / physiology,Male,Placenta,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Proteins / physiology,Pregnancy, Animal*,Ruminants,Interferon Type I,Pregnancy Proteins,interferon tau",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35772752
756,Recent advances and current controversies in genetic testing for personalized nutrition,"Purpose of review: Considerable interest in personalized nutrition exists among the general public, policymakers, healthcare organizations and the private sector, but there is also skepticism of its utility. The present review aims to provide a summary of current controversies in the field of nutrigenomics, and to highlight recent research on the potential impact of implementing genetic testing for personalized nutrition in practice. Recent findings: Numerous companies already offer genetic testing for personalized nutrition based on research developments in nutritional genomics. However, controversy exists over whethexr genetics contributes to interindividual responses to diet; the utility of single genetic variants versus genetic risk scores; the ability of DNA-based nutritional advice to elicit positive behavior change and health effects; and whether genetic information makes a difference on the type of dietary advice provided. Potential factors contributing to the discrepant viewpoints are discussed. Summary: Despite the existing controversies, a solid body of evidence demonstrates that genetic testing for personalized nutrition is a powerful tool to guide dietary recommendations to improve health and performance, and to elicit positive behavior change.","Affiliation 1 Department of Nutritional Sciences, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.","Bibiana Garcia-Bailo , Ahmed El-Sohemy",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,2021 Jul 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Diet,Genetic Testing,Humans,Nutrigenomics*,Nutritional Status,Precision Medicine*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33883417
757,Influence of multiparity on sympathetic nerve activity during normal pregnancy,"Recent evidence suggests an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease development in multiparous women. Therefore, we investigated the effects of multiparity on within-pregnancy sympathetic neural regulation in normotensive, pregnant women. We retrospectively analyzed heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; n = 8) data from 10 women whom participated in microneurographic research studies during two sequential pregnancies (i.e., PREG1 and PREG2). There was no difference in resting BP between pregnancies (P > 0.05), whereas HR trended higher in PREG2 versus PREG1 (P = 0.06). MSNA burst frequency was greater in PREG2 versus PREG1 after adjusting for age (32 ± 12 vs. 22 ± 12 bursts/min; P = 0.049), whereas burst incidence did not differ (40 ± 16 vs. 34 ± 17 bursts/100 heartbeats; P = 0.21). Sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity was not different between PREG1 and PREG2 (P > 0.05). Our results may highlight a possible role of altered within-pregnancy sympathetic neural regulation in the observed relationship in women between parity and future cardiovascular disease risk.NEW & NOTEWORTHY To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of multiparity on within-pregnancy sympathetic neural regulation. We observed augmented muscle sympathetic nerve activity in women's second studied pregnancy versus their first. Conversely, blood pressure and sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity did not differ, whereas a trend for increased heart rate was observed. Our results highlight a possible role of altered within-pregnancy sympathetic neural regulation in the relationship between increased parity and cardiovascular disease development.","Affiliations 1 Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, Dallas, Texas. 2 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas. 3 Program for Pregnancy and Postpartum Health, Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 4 Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Alberta Diabetes Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.","Mark B Badrov , Jeung-Ki Yoo , Craig D Steinback , Margie H Davenport , Qi Fu ",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,2020 Apr 1,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Blood Pressure,Female,Heart Rate,Humans,Muscle, Smooth, Vascular / physiology,Parity*,Pregnancy / physiology*,Sympathetic Nervous System / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32142381

Results: Parents in the mindful group had decreased harsh discipline practices and improved self-regulation compared to parents in the standard group. Both groups improved in parenting sense of competence and child ADHD symptoms. No significant group differences were found in mindful parenting or parenting stress. Conclusion: There are some important parental benefits to enhancing BPT with mindfulness.","Affiliations 1 BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada. 2 The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.","Janet W T Mah , Candice Murray , Jake Locke , Nicole Carbert ",J Atten Disord,2021 Oct,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity* / therapy,Behavior Therapy,Child,Humans,Mindfulness*,Parenting,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32532175
759,Growth patterns in children with spinal muscular atrophy,"Background: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness. SMA type 1 (SMA1) is the most severe form: affected infants are unable to sit unaided; SMA type 2 (SMA2) children can sit, but are not able to walk independently. The Standards of Care has improved quality of life and the increasing availability of disease-modifying treatments is progressively changing the natural history; so, the clinical assessment of nutritional status has become even more crucial. Aims of this multicenter study were to present the growth pattern of treatment-naïve SMA1 and SMA2, and to compare it with the general growth standards. Results: Body Weight (BW, kg) and Supine Length (SL, cm) were collected using a published standardized procedure. SMA-specific growth percentiles curves were developed and compared to the WHO reference data. We recruited 133 SMA1 and 82 SMA2 (48.8% females). Mean ages were 0.6 (0.4-1.6) and 4.1 (2.1-6.7) years, respectively. We present here a set of disease-specific percentiles curves of BW, SL, and BMI-for-age for girls and boys with SMA1 and SMA2. These curves show that BW is significantly lower in SMA than healthy peers, while SL is more variable. BMI is also typically lower in both sexes and at all ages. Conclusions: These data on treatment-naïve patients point toward a better understanding of growth in SMA and could be useful to improve the clinical management and to assess the efficacy of the available and forthcoming therapies not only on motor function, but also on growth.","Affiliations 1 International Center for the Assessment of Nutritional Status (ICANS), Department of Food, Environmental and Nutritional Sciences (DeFENS), University of Milan, Via Sandro Botticelli 21, 20133, Milan, Italy. ramona.deamicis@unimi.it. 2 UO Neurologia dello Sviluppo, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, Italy. 3 The Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL NIHR GOSH Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK. 4 International Center for the Assessment of Nutritional Status (ICANS), Department of Food, Environmental and Nutritional Sciences (DeFENS), University of Milan, Via Sandro Botticelli 21, 20133, Milan, Italy. 5 Dietetic and Nutrition Center, M.

Method: This study utilized a survey method with descriptive data without the intervention of variables but observed phenomena or sought the relationship between phenomena and other variables. The survey was conducted with an approach using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). There were 243 respondents obtained using the Lemeshow formula, while the data were analyzed using spatial techniques and Chi-Square test with p>0.05. Results: The results of spatial analysis using a 1: 50,000 scale map showed that; (1) high-risk and very high-risk pregnancies dominated Talise, (2) based on age, parity, pregnancy history, childbirth history, illness history, and CED status, cases of high-risk pregnancies were all detected in Talise, (3) age (p=0.000). Furthermore, pregnancy history (p=0.004) correlated with a high-risk pregnancy. Besides, parity, childbirth history, illness history, and CED status did not correlate with high-risk pregnancy since the p-value>0.05; (4) age and pregnancy history influenced the high-risk pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Public Health, Universitas Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia.

761,Early adolescent food routines: A photo-elicitation study,"Early adolescence (ages 10-14) encompasses a critical transition period in which food and nutrition decisions are shifting in important ways. Food routines are food-based activities that repeat across days, weeks, seasons, or lives. Examining routines can provide insight into how individuals are influenced in food choices. The objective of this study was to describe current influences on and experiences with food routines during early adolescence. In-depth interviews, using a photo-elicitation approach, were conducted with 30 participants (16 females; 14 males) in the United States. Participants took photos that were then used during the interview to describe food-related decisions and influences. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis was guided by a grounded theory approach to identify emergent themes related to routines and resulted in the development of a conceptual model for early adolescent food routines. Participants identified a wide range of routines and three main themes emerged: family, settings, and meals/foods consumed. Some had highly established routines throughout the week, while others described routines only for certain meals or days. Several participants described increased control or the ability to modify routines around some eating episodes such as snacks, lunches, and weekend breakfasts. Findings revealed how participants viewed eating routines and provided information about food-and nutrition-related behaviors that can inform future research and practice. Early adolescents appear to have complex food routines influenced by structures and different amounts of control.","Affiliations 1 Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University, Cornell University, Savage Hall- Room 214, 244 Garden Avenue, Ithaca, NY, 14853, United States.

762,What Will It Take to Build an Expert Group of Nutrigenomic Practitioners?,"Background: The past two decades have seen exponential growth in the number of genetic testing companies, but only a small percentage of these tests are being sold through health care professionals (HCPs). As each new genetic testing company appears, it is becoming more difficult for the practitioner and consumer to evaluate the credibility of the claims being made and the value of the tests being offered. Summary: HCPs appear to have minimal nutrigenomics knowledge and little confidence in choosing and interpreting nutrigenetic tests. To remedy this, HCPs need access to credible education, professional support, networking, career development, mentorship, and a regulated testing environment. This will enable them to evaluate the credibility of genetic tests and testing companies, provide genetic results in context, and apply appropriate clinical translation. Key Message: In order to establish an expert group of nutrigenomic practitioners, collaboration is required between educational institutions, professional organizations, and genetic testing companies. This will provide the necessary support, skills, and knowledge to ensure that the best value is extracted from nutrigenetic tests in an ethical and responsible manner.","Affiliations 1 Maryland University of Integrative Health, Laurel, Maryland, USA, Yael@manukascience.co.za. 2 3X4 Genetics, Cape Town, South Africa, Yael@manukascience.co.za. 3 3X4 Genetics, Cape Town, South Africa.","Yael Joffe , Heléne Herholdt ",Lifestyle Genom,2020,"Editorial,Commerce,Educational Status,Evidence-Based Medicine,Expert Testimony,Genetic Testing*,Genome, Human,Health Personnel*,Health Promotion,Humans,Interprofessional Relations,Life Style,Nutrigenomics / education,Nutrigenomics / standards*,Nutritional Sciences / education,Nutritional Sciences / standards*,Research Design,Societies, Medical,Translational Research, Biomedical,United Kingdom,United States",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32369817

764,[A hybrid attention temporal sequential network for sleep stage classification],"Sleep stage classification is a necessary fundamental method for the diagnosis of sleep diseases, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Traditional methods for sleep stage classification, such as manual marking methods and machine learning algorithms, have the limitations of low efficiency and defective generalization. Recently, deep neural networks have shown improved results by the capability of learning complex pattern in the sleep data. However, these models ignore the intra-temporal sequential information and the correlation among all channels in each segment of the sleep data. To solve these problems, a hybrid attention temporal sequential network model is proposed in this paper, choosing recurrent neural network to replace traditional convolutional neural network, and extracting temporal features of polysomnography from the perspective of time. Furthermore, intra-temporal attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism are adopted to achieve the fusion of the intra-temporal representation and the fusion of channel-correlated representation. And then, based on recurrent neural network and inter-temporal attention mechanism, this model further realized the fusion of inter-temporal contextual representation. Finally, the end-to-end automatic sleep stage classification is accomplished according to the above hybrid representation. This paper evaluates the proposed model based on two public benchmark sleep datasets downloaded from open-source website, which include a number of polysomnography. Experimental results show that the proposed model could achieve better performance compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. The overall accuracy of sleep stage classification could reach 0.801, 0.801 and 0.717, respectively. Meanwhile, the macro average F1-scores of the proposed model could reach 0.752, 0.728 and 0.700. All experimental results could demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, P.R.China. 2 Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks, Beijing 100124, P.R.China. 3 Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, P.R.China. 4 JD Intelligent Cities Research, Beijing 100190, P.R.China.","Zheng Jin , Kebin Jia , Ye Yuan ",Sheng Wu Yi Xue Gong Cheng Xue Za Zhi,2021 Apr 25,"Electroencephalography*,Neural Networks, Computer,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Stages*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33913283
765,Sleepiness is a signal to go to bed: data and model simulations,"Study objectives: Assess the validity of a subjective measure of sleepiness as an indicator of sleep drive by quantifying associations between intraindividual variation in evening sleepiness and bedtime, sleep duration, and next morning and subsequent evening sleepiness, in young adults. Methods: Sleep timing and sleepiness were assessed in 19 students in late autumn and late spring on a total of 771 days. Karolinska Sleepiness Scales (KSS) were completed at half-hourly intervals at fixed clock times starting 4 h prior to participants' habitual bedtime, and in the morning. Associations between sleepiness and sleep timing were evaluated by mixed model and nonparametric approaches and simulated with a mathematical model for the homeostatic and circadian regulation of sleepiness. Results: Intraindividual variation in evening sleepiness was very large, covering four or five points on the 9-point KSS scale, and was significantly associated with subsequent sleep timing. On average, a one point higher KSS value was followed by 20 min earlier bedtime, which led to 11 min longer sleep, which correlated with lower sleepiness next morning and the following evening. Associations between sleepiness and sleep timing were stronger in early compared to late sleepers. Model simulations indicated that the directions of associations between sleepiness and sleep timing are in accordance with their homeostatic and circadian regulation, even though much of the variance in evening sleepiness and details of its time course remain unexplained by the model. Conclusion: Subjective sleepiness is a valid indicator of the drive for sleep which, if acted upon, can reduce insufficient sleep.","Affiliations 1 Cheryl Spencer Department of Nursing, Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel. 2 Surrey Sleep Research Centre, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom. 3 Department of Psychology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom. 4 UK Dementia Research Institute, Care Research & Technology Centre, at Imperial College London and the University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom. 5 Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom.","Tamar Shochat , Nayantara Santhi , Paula Herer , Derk-Jan Dijk , Anne C Skeldon ",Sleep,2021 Oct 11,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Circadian Rhythm*,Humans,Sleep,Sleep Deprivation,Sleepiness*,Wakefulness,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33991415

Forty-five firefighters were assessed to determine the impact of their shift schedule on sleep duration, sleep quality, processing speed, sustained attention, vigilance, and mental health. Assessments were conducted at the start and end of shift. Firefighters endorsed sleeping 5 hours 21 minutes at work, and the results suggest that even minimal sleep disruption affected cognitive functioning (e.g. processing speed, visual-motor coordination, and reaction time), increasing the likelihood of poor work performance or injury.","Affiliations 1 James A.

Historically, there is a lack of formalized nutrition training in both medical school and residency programs.Objective: This study surveyed a group of family medicine residents to elicit previous nutrition education and outlook on nutrition counseling. A measure of resident attitudes toward nutrition education and comfort with relaying nutrition education to patients was conducted.Design: A validated, self-administered questionnaire was administered. The survey was composed of 32 questions with yes/no or Likert scale response.Participants and setting: Participants were 30 family medicine residents in the final quarter of their individual postgraduate year of training (PGY1-3). A total of 23 residents electively responded.Results: The majority surveyed conveyed nutrition education in routine care is important in a physician-patient relationship. Except in diabetes, the overwhelming majority reported they were not adequately trained to give nutrition education in specific disease states. The group was not familiar with types of diets, the role of fatty acids, or the impact of specific vitamins on health.Conclusions: The data from this survey indicate a need for formalized nutrition education in primary care training. From the survey data results, the next steps include building a nutrition curriculum to be implemented in the residency program and potentially set a standard for nutrition education in the North Carolina region and beyond.","Affiliation 1 Wake Forest School of Medicine, Department of Family and Community Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina.","Lisa Cassidy-Vu , Julienne Kirk ",J Am Coll Nutr,2020 Mar-Apr,"Counseling,Curriculum*,Family Practice / education,Humans,Internship and Residency*,Nutritional Sciences / education*,Patient Education as Topic,Primary Health Care / methods*,Schools, Medical,Surveys and Questionnaires",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31397643
770,Planned Home Birth in Low-Risk Pregnancies in Spain: A Descriptive Study,"Previous studies have shown that planned home birth in low-risk pregnancies is a generally safe option. However nowadays, only 0.5 percent of deliveries have been at home in Spain. This study sought to understand the characteristics of planned home births with qualified healthcare professionals in low-risk pregnancies and their results on maternal and neonatal health in the Balearic Islands. The study followed a retrospective descriptive design to investigate planned home births from 1989 to 2019 (n = 820). Sociodemographic data of women, healthcare professional intervention rates, and maternal/fetal morbidity/mortality results were collected. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the IBM SPSS Version 25 software package. The results indicated that women with low-risk pregnancies who planned home births with a qualified midwife had a higher probability of spontaneous vaginal birth delivery and positive maternal health results. Furthermore, the risk of hospital transfer was low (10.7%) and the rate of prolonged breastfeeding (>1 year) was extremely high (99%). Moreover, the study showed that planned home births can be generally associated with fetal well-being. The conclusions and implications of this study are that planned home births in low-risk pregnancies attended by qualified midwives in the Balearic Islands achieve positive results in both maternal and newborn health, as well as low rates of obstetric intervention.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nursing, Physiotherapy and Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Almería, 04120 Almería, Spain. 2 Research Group for Health Sciences CST-451, University of Almería, 04120 Almería, Spain.","Trinidad M Galera-Barbero , Gabriel Aguilera-Manrique ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Apr 5,"Delivery, Obstetric,Female,Home Childbirth*,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Midwifery*,Pregnancy,Retrospective Studies,Spain",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33916388
771,Lifestyle Genetics-Based Reports in the Treatment of Obesity,"Obesity becomes a chronic disease due to the increasing number of mortality and morbidity cases around the world. In most regions, chronic illnesses, such as obesity, are important sources of morbidity and mortality. Due to a lack of effective strategies for prevention and management, the adverse effects of obesity and related diseases on health continue to be a serious problem. Relevant information was searched from Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed using such different terms as ""Obesity"", ""Obesity Management"", ""Obesity AND Physical activity"", ""Obesity AND Genetics"", ""Obesity AND Diet"", and ""Obesity AND Nutrigenomics"". Obesity is characterized by a complex interaction of hereditary and lifestyle factors, which includes food. Diet is an environmental element that plays an important and considerable role in the management of health and reduces the risk of obesity and its comorbidities. Changes in lifestyle patterns not only help burn extra calories but also prevent the development of obesity via its modulating effect on genetic factors. Different people respond differently to an obesogenic environment. The notion of nutrigenetics emerged as a result of various genetic variations that may explain this heterogeneity. Nutritional genomics, also known as nutrigenetics, is the study that investigates and analyses gene variations linked to varied responses to certain foods; moreover, it links this variation to diseases, such as obesity. As a result, tailored nutrition advice based on a person's genetic profile may improve the outcomes of a specific dietary strategy and offer a novel dietary strategy to improve life quality and preventing obesity. This study concluded that physical activity and dietary interventions play an effective role in the management of obesity. Moreover, understanding of the function of the most prominent obesity-related genes, as well as the interaction between nutrition and gene expression, will help researchers design personalized treatment strategies for humans.","Affiliations 1 Société Francophone de Nutrithérapie et de Nutrigénétique Appliquée, Villeurbanne, France. 2 Inochi Care Private Limited, New Delhi-110017, India. 3 Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan, Pakistan. 4 Research and Development Department, Nutri-Logics SA, Weiswampach, Luxembourg. 5 Laboratoires Réunis, Junglinster, Luxembourg.","A Gasmi , P K Mujawdiya , S Noor , S Piscopo , A Menzel ",Arch Razi Inst,2021 Oct 31,"Review,Animals,Life Style*,Nutrigenomics*,Nutritional Status,Obesity / genetics,Obesity / prevention & control,Obesity / veterinary",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35096307
772,Reduced sleep spindle activity in children with primary snoring,"Background: Habitually snoring children are at risk of manifesting disease-related problems even if their sleep studies are overall within normal limits. Study objectives: To compare sleep spindle activity in children with primary snoring and healthy controls. Methods: Sleep spindle activity including analysis of fast and slow spindles (ie, >13 Hz and <13 Hz, respectively) was evaluated in polysomnographic (PSG) recordings of 20 randomly selected children with primary snoring (PS; normal PSG recordings except for objective presence of snoring; 12 boys, mean age 6.5 ± 2.1 years), and 20 age- and gender-matched PSG-confirmed non-snoring controls. Results: PS children showed significantly lower spindle indices in all non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages (p < 0.05). In contrast, fast spindles were found in 40% (n = 8) children with PS and in 25% (n = 5) controls. Sleep spindle activity was particularly higher in NREM sleep stage 2 in controls compared PS (76% versus 43% of all marked sleep spindles events in NREM sleep stage 2, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Children with PS exhibit significantly reduced spindle activity when compared to matched controls. Reduced sleep spindle activity may be an indicator of sleep disruption and, therefore, could be involved in the development of disease-related consequences in snoring children.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Pulmonology, Division of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile; Pediatric Sleep Center, School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

773,Sleep staging from electrocardiography and respiration with deep learning,"Study objectives: Sleep is reflected not only in the electroencephalogram but also in heart rhythms and breathing patterns. We hypothesized that it is possible to accurately stage sleep based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals. Methods: Using a dataset including 8682 polysomnograms, we develop deep neural networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory signals. Five deep neural networks consisting of convolutional networks and long- and short-term memory networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and breathing, including the timing of R peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest respiratory effort, and the combinations of these signals. Results: ECG in combination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieved the best performance for staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.585 (95% confidence interval ±0.017); and 0.760 (±0.019) for discriminating awake vs. rapid eye movement vs. nonrapid eye movement sleep. Performance is better for younger ages, whereas it is robust for body mass index, apnea severity, and commonly used outpatient medications. Conclusions: Our results validate that ECG and respiratory effort provide substantial information about sleep stages in a large heterogeneous population. This opens new possibilities in sleep research and applications where electroencephalography is not readily available or may be infeasible.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. 2 Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. 3 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.","Haoqi Sun , Wolfgang Ganglberger , Ezhil Panneerselvam , Michael J Leone , Syed A Quadri , Balaji Goparaju , Ryan A Tesh , Oluwaseun Akeju , Robert J Thomas , M Brandon Westover ",Sleep,2020 Jul 13,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Deep Learning*,Electrocardiography,Respiration,Sleep,Sleep Stages",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31863111
774,Perinatal outcome after planned vaginal delivery in monochorionic compared with dichorionic twin pregnancy,"Objective: To assess, according to chorionicity, the perinatal outcome of twin pregnancy in which vaginal delivery is planned. Methods: JUMODA (JUmeaux MODe d'Accouchement) was a national prospective population-based cohort study of twin pregnancies, delivered in 176 maternity units in France, from February 2014 to March 2015. In this planned secondary analysis, we assessed, according to chorionicity, the perinatal outcome of twin pregnancies, in which vaginal delivery was planned, that delivered at or after 32 weeks of gestation with the first twin in cephalic presentation. In order to select a population with well-recognized indications for planned vaginal delivery, we applied the same exclusion criteria as those in the Twin Birth Study, an international randomized trial. Monochorionic twin pregnancies with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome or twin anemia-polycythemia sequence were defined as complicated and were excluded. The primary outcome was a composite of intrapartum mortality and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to control for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to birth order (first or second twin) and gestational age at delivery (< 37 or ≥ 37 weeks of gestation). Results: Among 3873 twin pregnancies, in which vaginal delivery was planned, that delivered at ≥ 32 weeks' gestation with the first twin in cephalic presentation, meeting the inclusion criteria of the Twin Birth Study, 729 (18.8%) were uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies and 3144 (81.2%) were dichorionic twin pregnancies. The rate of composite intrapartum mortality and neonatal morbidity and mortality did not differ between uncomplicated monochorionic (27/1458 (1.9%)) and dichorionic (107/6288 (1.7%)) twin pregnancies when adjusting for conception by assisted reproductive technologies (adjusted relative risk, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.66-1.75)). No significant difference in the primary outcome was found between the groups on subgroup analyses according to birth order and gestational age at delivery. Conclusion: When vaginal delivery is planned, and delivery occurs at ≥ 32 weeks of gestation with the first twin in cephalic presentation, uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancy is not associated with a higher rate of composite intrapartum mortality and neonatal morbidity and mortality compared with dichorionic twin pregnancy. © 2020 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Affiliations 1 Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Robert Debré, Service de Gynécologie Obstétrique, Paris, France. 2 Université de Paris, Centre for Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cité (CRESS), Obstetrical Perinatal and Pediatric Epidemiology Research Team, EPOPé, INSERM, INRA, Paris, France. 3 Maternité Notre Dame de Bon Secours, Groupe Hospitalier Saint-Joseph, Paris, France. 4 CHRU de Lille, Maternité Jeanne de Flandre, Lille, France. 5 Université de Lille 2, Lille, France. 6 Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Poissy, Service de Gynécologie Obstétrique, Poissy, France. 7 Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Versailles, France. 8 Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Bicêtre, Service de Gynécologie Obstétrique, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, Paris, France. 9 Université Paris Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, Paris, France. 10 CHU de Bordeaux, Service de Gynécologie Obstétrique, Bordeaux, France. 11 Université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. 12 CHU de Toulouse, Service de Gynécologie Obstétrique, Toulouse, France. 13 Université Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France. 14 CHU de Nantes, Service de Gynécologie Obstétrique, Nantes, France. 15 Université de Nantes, Nantes, France. 16 Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Maternité Port-Royal, Paris, France. 17 DHU Risques et Grossesse, Paris, France.","T Schmitz , D Korb , E Azria , C Garabédian , P Rozenberg , M V Sénat , L Sentilhes , C Vayssière , N Winer , F Goffinet , JUmeaux MODe d'Accouchement (JUMODA) Study Group and the Groupe de Recherche en Obstétrique et Gynécologie (GROG)",Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,2021 Apr,"Multicenter Study,Observational Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Chorion,Delivery, Obstetric / methods,Delivery, Obstetric / statistics & numerical data*,Female,France / epidemiology,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Labor Presentation,Obstetric Labor Complications / epidemiology*,Perinatal Mortality,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology*,Pregnancy, Twin*,Prospective Studies,Twins / statistics & numerical data*,Vagina",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33078466
775,The Effects of Sleep Quality on Dream and Waking Emotions,"Despite the increasing interest in sleep and dream-related processes of emotion regulation, their reflection into waking and dream emotional experience remains unclear. We have previously described a discontinuity between wakefulness and dreaming, with a prevalence of positive emotions in wakefulness and negative emotions during sleep. Here we aim to investigate whether this profile may be affected by poor sleep quality. Twenty-three 'Good Sleepers' (GS) and 27 'Poor Sleepers' (PS), identified through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) cut-off score, completed three forms of the modified Differential Emotions Scale, assessing, respectively, the frequency of 22 emotions over the past 2 weeks, their intensity during dreaming and during the previous day. The ANOVA revealed a different pattern of emotionality between groups: GS showed high positive emotionality in wakefulness (both past 2 weeks and 24 h) with a significant shift to negative emotionality in dreams, while PS showed evenly distributed emotional valence across all three conditions. No significant regression model emerged between waking and dream affect. In the frame of recent hypotheses on the role of dreaming in emotion regulation, our findings suggest that the different day/night expression of emotions between groups depends on a relative impairment of sleep-related processes of affect regulation in poor sleepers. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of including sleep quality assessments in future dream studies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Campania L.

777,Using Interactive Nutrition Modules to Increase Critical Thinking Skills in College Courses,"Objective: To understand how the addition of an evidence-based framework to an online nutrition module influences college students' critical thinking decision making (CT-DM). Design: Students were individually randomized into an intervention group or a control group. The nutrition modules focused on 2 topics related to different types of eating behavior. Students completed a CT-DM activity to generate a score. Participants: College students, between 18 and 24 years old, recruited from introductory nutrition and agriculture science courses at 2 universities. Intervention: Intervention and control received 2 nutrition modules. The intervention added a CT-DM framework that framed the topic as a problem, incorporated activities, and provided scaffolding. Main outcome measures: CT-DM was scored using a validated rubric to assess the use of critical thinking skills when making a food-related decision. Green eating and critical thinking disposition were measured. Analysis: Hierarchical linear regression and t tests were used to assess outcomes. Results: A total of 431 students participated (intervention = 203; control = 228). After controlling for university, the intervention group scored significantly higher on CT-DM (18.1 ± 7.6) compared with the control (15.4 ± 8.4); F (3,428) = 14.58, P < .001. Conclusions and implications: The results show that an evidence-based framework using nutrition topics encourages CT-DM skills. Future higher-education nutrition interventions should use frameworks to enhance student learning.","Affiliations 1 School of Food and Agriculture, University of Maine, Orono, ME.

779,Dietetics After Spinal Cord Injury: Current Evidence and Future Perspectives,"Following spinal cord injury (SCI), individuals are at high risk for obesity and several chronic cardiometabolic disorders due to a deterioration in body composition, hypometabolic rate, and endometabolic dysregulation. Countermeasures to the consequences of an SCI include adopting a healthy diet that provides adequate nutrition to maintain good body habitus and cardiometabolic health. A proper diet for individuals with SCI should distribute carbohydrates, protein, and fat to optimize a lower energy intake requirement and should stress foods with low caloric yet high nutrient density. The purpose of this article is to present available evidence on how nutritional status after SCI should advance future research to further develop SCI-specific guidelines for total energy intake, as it relates to percent carbohydrates, protein, fat, and all vitamins and minerals, that take into consideration the adaptations after SCI.","Affiliations 1 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida. 2 The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida.","Gary J Farkas , Alicia Sneij , David R Gater Jr ",Top Spinal Cord Inj Rehabil,2021,"Review,Dietetics / methods*,Energy Intake*,Humans,Nutritional Status*,Obesity / complications*,Obesity / diet therapy*,Spinal Cord Injuries / complications*,Spinal Cord Injuries / diet therapy*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33814888

781,Normal sleep development in infants: findings from two large birth cohorts,"Objective: Sleep difficulties are highly prevalent and often persistent in young children, but sometimes parents are worried about sleep symptoms that belong to the normative range rather than to actual disturbances. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the normative development of sleep at the ages of 3, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months in healthy children. Methods: The present study is based on two birth cohorts that comprise representative samples of families recruited systematically during pregnancy. In the CHILD-SLEEP cohort, the sample sizes were 1427 at three, 1301 at eight, 1163 at 18, and 950 at 24 months. In the Finnbrain cohort, the sample sizes were 2002 at six months and 1693 at 12 months. Healthy term-born children were eligible for this study. To assess the infants' sleep duration and sleep quality, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire was used in both cohorts and additionally the Infant Sleep Questionnaire in the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. The distributions of the study variables were reported using standard parameters. Results: We found that sleep quality is highly variable particularly during the first two years of life, but this variability decreased markedly towards the second year. First, sleep latency decreased by the age of six months, while night-time sleep began to consolidate during the second year. However, parent-reported sleeping problems were common during the entire study period. Conclusion: As many families struggle with infants' sleeping problems, the reference values reported in this article can be valuable tools in various clinical settings to define clinically significant deviances in the sleep development and to identify individuals benefitting from counselling and clinical interventions.","Affiliations 1 Paediatric Research Center, Child Psychiatry, the University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland; Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.

783,Week-by-week changes in sleep EEG in healthy full-term newborns,"Spectral analysis of neonatal sleep is useful for studying brain maturation; however, most studies have analyzed conventional broad bands described for awake adults, so a distinct approach for EEG analysis may disclose new findings. Study objectives: To extract independent EEG broad bands using principal component analysis (PCA) and describe week-by-week EEG changes in quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS) during the first 5 weeks of postnatal life in healthy, full-term newborns. Methods: Polysomnography of spontaneous sleep was recorded in 60 newborns in 5 groups at 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45 weeks (n = 12 each) postconceptional age (POST-C). QS and AS stages were identified. Absolute power (AP) for 1 Hz bins between 1 and 30 Hz was subjected to PCA to extract independent broad bands. Results: PCA rendered three independent broad bands distinct from conventional bands. They explained 82.8% of variance: 2-10 Hz, 10-16 Hz, and 17-30 Hz. ANOVAs (group × age × derivations) showed significant higher power at 2-10 Hz with greater age, higher power in QS than AS in all three bands, and significantly higher AP in the left central region, and in the right occipital and temporal areas, in both sleep stages. Conclusion: A different method of analyzing sleep EEG generated new information on brain maturation. The Sigma frequencies identified suggest that sleep spindle maturation begins by at least 41 weeks of POST-C age. Interhemispheric asymmetries during sleep suggest earlier development of the central left region and the right occipital and temporal areas.","Affiliations 1 Research Unit in Neurodevelopment, Institute of Neurobiology, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Querétaro. 2 Sleep Laboratory, Faculty of Psychology, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico, Mexico.","María Corsi-Cabrera , Lourdes Cubero-Rego , Josefina Ricardo-Garcell , Thalia Harmony ",Sleep,2020 Apr 15,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Electroencephalography*,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Stages*,Sleep, REM",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31650177
784,Physical activity and sleep during the first week of anorexia nervosa inpatient care,"Background: Individuals with Anorexia Nervosa are often described as restless, hyperactive and having disturbed sleep. The result reproducibility and generalisability of these results are low due to the use of unreliable methods, different measurement methods and outcome measures. A reliable method to measure both physical activity and sleep is through accelerometry. The main purpose of the study was to quantify the physical activity and sleeping behaviour of anorexia nervosa patients. Another purpose was to increase result reproducibility and generalisability of the study. Material and methods: Accelerometer data were collected from the first week of treatment of anorexia nervosa at an inpatient ward. Raw data from the Axivity AX3© accelerometer was used with the open-source package GGIR for analysis, in the free statistical software R. Accelerometer measurements were transformed into euclidean norm minus one with negative values rounded to zero (ENMO). Physical activity measurements of interest were 24h average ENMO, daytime average ENMO, inactivity, light activity, moderate activity, and vigorous activity. Sleep parameters of interest were sleep duration, sleep efficiency, awakenings, and wake after sleep onset. The sleep duration of different age groups was compared to recommendations by the National Sleep Foundation using a Fisher's exact test. Results: Of 67 patients, due to data quality 58 (93% female) were included in the analysis. Average age of participants was 17.8 (±6.9) years and body mass index was 15.5 (±1.9) kg/m2. Daytime average ENMO was 17.4 (±5.1) mg. Participants spent 862.6 (±66.2) min per day inactive, 88.4 (±22.6) min with light activities, 25.8 (±16.7) min with moderate activities and 0.5 (±1.8) min with vigorous activities. Participants slept for 461.0 (±68.4) min, waking up 1.45 (±1.25) times per night for 54.6 (±35.8) min, having an average sleep quality of 0.88 (±0.10). 31% of participants met sleep recommendations, with a significantly higher number of 6-13 year old patients failing to reach recommendations compared to 14-25 year old patients. Conclusion: The patient group spent most of their time inactive at the beginning of treatment. Most patients failed to reach sleep recommendations. The use of raw data and opensource software should ensure result reproducibility, enable comparison across points in treatment and comparison with healthy individuals.","Affiliations 1 Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Center for Alzheimer Research, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. 2 Mandometer Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden.","Billy Langlet , Fannie Vestermark , Josefin Stolt , Modjtaba Zandian , Per Södersten , Cecilia Bergh ",PLoS One,2021 Nov 16,"Observational Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Accelerometry,Adolescent,Adult,Anorexia Nervosa / physiopathology*,Anorexia Nervosa / psychology,Anorexia Nervosa / therapy,Child,Exercise / physiology*,Exercise / psychology,Female,Humans,Inpatients,Male,Reproducibility of Results,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Quality,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34784383
785,Custody and Child Symptomatology in High Conflict Divorce: An Analysis of Latent Profiles,"Background: There is much controversy about the impact of joint physical custody on child symptomatology in the context of high interparental conflict. In this study we analyzed child symptomatology with person-centered methodology, identifying differential profiles, considering post-divorce custody, parental symptomatology, and coparenting variables. We examined the association between these profiles and child symptomatology, as well as the mediating role of parenting in that association. Method: The participants were 303 divorced or separated Spanish parents with high interparental conflict. We used the study of latent profiles and the INDIRECT procedure in Mplus. We also controlled for the variables age and number of children, new partners, frequency of the relationship with the ex-partner, time elapsed since the divorce, and gender of the parent. Results: From the parents' perspective, the profile characterized by low parental symptomatology and high coparenting, regardless of the type of custody, was related to children exhibiting less somatic, anxious, and depressive symptomatology, and aggressive behavior. The mediating role of parenting was also identified. Conclusions: Parental symptomatology, coparenting, and parenting are essential for understanding post-divorce child symptomatology and the study highlights importance of person-centered multidimensional models.",Affiliation 1 University of Deusto.,"Ana Martínez-Pampliega , Marta Herrero, Susana Cormenzana, Susana Corral, Mireia Sanz, Laura Merino, Leire Iriarte, Iñigo Ochoa de Alda, Leire Alcañiz, Irati Álvarez",Psicothema,2021 Feb,"Child,Child Custody,Divorce*,Family Conflict,Humans,Parent-Child Relations,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33453741
786,"Shift rotation scheme, sleepiness and sleep quality in night-shift workers","Background: Shift rotation schemes can influence workers' tolerance of night-shift work and its impact on health. Aims: This study was aimed to assess the influence of shift work rotation schemes on sleepiness and sleep quality. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 145 male workers, 77 from a ceramic tile factory on a fixed, forward-rotating shift work scheme, and 68 from a dockyard company, working on-call night shifts. Participants self-administered the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires and provided data on demographic and lifestyle variables. We set two logistic regression models to predict the risk of daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality as a function of night-shift work and on-call night shifts, adjusting for personal and lifestyle covariates. Results: Marital status, body mass index, smoking and alcohol intake did not affect ESS and PSQI scores, nor did they differ between the two cohorts. Night-shift workers from both cohorts were more likely to have a PSQI score ≥6, suggestive of poor sleep quality, with no variation between the two cohorts. ESS scores suggestive of daytime sleepiness were strongly associated with on-call night shifts among dockyard workers for (odds ratio = 13.4; 95% confidence interval 2.9-63.9), in respect the regular, forward-rotating night-shift work among ceramic tile factory workers. Discussion: Daytime sleepiness occurred more frequently among dockyard workers working on-call night shifts. Poor sleep quality occurred more frequently among night-shift workers, but it did not differ between the two companies.","Affiliations 1 Interdepartmental Sleep Research Centre, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, SS 554, km 4,500, Monserrato, 09042 Cagliari, Italy. 2 Unit of Occupational Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, SS 554, km 4,500, Monserrato, 09042 Cagliari, Italy. 3 Division of Population Health, Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.","R Lecca , M Puligheddu , G M Acar , M Figorilli , P Congiu , G Gioi , R Loscerbo , F Meloni , S De Matteis , P Cocco ",Occup Med (Lond),2021 Dec 24,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Cross-Sectional Studies,Humans,Male,Sleep,Sleep Quality*,Sleepiness*,Surveys and Questionnaires,Work Schedule Tolerance",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34693976
787,Complementary contributions of non-REM and REM sleep to visual learning,"Sleep is beneficial for learning. However, it remains unclear whether learning is facilitated by non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or by REM sleep, whether it results from plasticity increases or stabilization, and whether facilitation results from learning-specific processing. Here, we trained volunteers on a visual task and measured the excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance in early visual areas during subsequent sleep as an index of plasticity. The E/I balance increased during NREM sleep irrespective of whether pre-sleep learning occurred, but it was associated with post-sleep performance gains relative to pre-sleep performance. In contrast, the E/I balance decreased during REM sleep but only after pre-sleep training, and the decrease was associated with stabilization of pre-sleep learning. These findings indicate that NREM sleep promotes plasticity, leading to performance gains independent of learning, while REM sleep decreases plasticity to stabilize learning in a learning-specific manner.","Affiliations 1 Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA. 2 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Kawasaki, Japan. 3 Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA. 4 Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, RI, USA. yuka_sasaki@brown.edu.","Masako Tamaki , Zhiyan Wang , Tyler Barnes-Diana , DeeAnn Guo , Aaron V Berard , Edward Walsh , Takeo Watanabe , Yuka Sasaki ",Nat Neurosci,2020 Sep,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Brain / physiology*,Female,Humans,Male,Neuronal Plasticity / physiology*,Photic Stimulation,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep, REM / physiology*,Spatial Learning / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32690968

789,Facilitators and barriers of herbal medicine use in diabetic patients: A qualitative study,"Background: In several countries such as Iran, the use of complementary and alternative medical products like herbal medicine is growing. There is, however, a lack of research on the prospects of herbal medicine patrons regarding facilitators and herbal medicine use barriers. The aim of this study was to explain the facilitators and the barriers of herbal medicine use in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Materials and methods: Qualitative one-to-one in-depth interviews were conducted with patients with T2DM from the Yazd Diabetes Research Center, using a semi-structured guide. For the recruitment of T2DM participants who used herbal medicine beside conventional medicine, purposeful sampling was used. Analysis of the data was carried out using the steps proposed by Graneheim and Landman strategies. Results: Sixteen patients were interviewed. There were 2 subjects (facilitators and barriers herbal medicine use), 8 categories, and 89 initial codes. The facilitators included individual preferences, preparation skills, and family support and the factors obstructing the use of herbal medicine included insufficient skills about preparing, lack of easy access to consumption, insufficient of efficacy of herbal medicine, and negative properties of herbal medicine and taking time in preparing herbal medicine. Conclusion: Although some people use herbal medicine, the interest in use of herbal medicine is limited because of inadequate awareness of the impact and usage them. Therefore, the use of effective strategy in the integration of herbal remedies with conventional medicine can promote well-being of patients.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Research Center for Nursing and Midwifery Care in Family Health, Shahid Sadughi University of Medical Science, Yazd, Iran. 2 Department of Health Education and Promotion, School of Public Health, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran. 3 Diabetes Research Center, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran. 4 Health System Research Unit, Health Center of Urmia, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran.","Ali Akbar Vaezi , Ahmad Sotoudeh , Nasim Namiranian , Mojtaba Fattahi Ardakani , Moradali Zareipour ",J Educ Health Promot,2021 Aug 31,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34667803
790,Patterns of parenting: revisiting mechanistic models,"This commentary argues for the need to revisit the foundations of attachment theory and its tradition of formulating testable mechanistic models of relationship development and change. Modeling and simulation may be useful to test novel theoretical propositions, such as the one stating that pleasure in parenting may be a determinant of secure father-infant attachment relationships (Brown & Cox, this issue). We discuss this proposition's plausibility, by relating parenting pleasure to the temporal patterning of parenting, a neglected property in parent-child interaction. Simulation work may not only offer first test runs of novel hypotheses, but may also guide empirical researchers to the most likely time-scale on which such hypotheses should be tested.","Affiliation 1 Section of Clinical Child and Family Studies, Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.","Carlo Schuengel , Anne Tharner ",Attach Hum Dev,2020 Feb,"Father-Child Relations,Fathers / psychology,Humans,Infant,Models, Psychological*,Object Attachment*,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology*,Parents / psychology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30898035
791,The effect of the herbal medicine on severity of cyclic mastalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Cyclic mastalgia is one of the most prevalent problems in women of reproductive age and sometimes it is so severe that it influences their activities and requires treatment. The available drug treatments for mastalgia are not satisfactory and most patients have inclined towards complementary and alternative medicine including herbal medicines. Therefore, in order to evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of herbal medicines conducting systematic review studies and meta-analysis seems essential, thus this systematic review was conducted with the aim of determining the effect of herbal medicines on cyclic mastalgia and its probable side effects. The databases of Pubmed, Medline, Embase, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of science, Complementary Medicine Database, SID (Scientific information database), Magiran and Iranmedex were searched from 1997 to 2020 and limited only for English and Persian languages. The studies were appraised according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to assess an overall estimate of effectiveness for the continuous data. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated for dichotomous data. Thirty papers were included in the study. Meta-analysis of data demonstrated that herbal medicine was an effective method in reducing the severity of mastalgia compared to the placebo (SMD: -3.26, 95% CI: -5.05 to -1.46, p=0.00004). Subanalysis of data showed no difference between the effectiveness of herbal medicine on the severity of mastalgia compared to the pharmacologic treatment. This research demonstrated efficacy of herbal medicines in alleviating cyclic mastalgia. Therefore, these herbal medicines can be regarded as an alternative treatment for women suffering from cyclic mastalgia. However, due to the limited number of studies in relation to each specific herbal treatment, conducting further studies in this area is recommended.","Affiliations 1 Department of Midwifery, Students Research Committee, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Tabriz University of Medical sciences, Tabriz, Iran. 2 South Asia Infant Feeding Research Network (SAIFRN), School of Nursing, Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia. 3 Department of Health Education and Health Promotion, Faculty of Health, Tabriz University of Medical sciences, Tabriz, Iran. 4 Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.","Shirin Osouli Tabrizi , Shahla Meedya , Nafiseh Ghassab-Abdollahia , Zahra Ghorbani , Leila Jahangiry , Mojgan Mirghafourvand ",J Complement Integr Med,2021 May 20.,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34107571
792,The importance of responsive parenting for vulnerable infants,"The quality of the early caregiving context sets the stage for the developing child's long term developmental trajectory. Infants are born highly dependent on parents and other caregivers for critical input for developing brain and behavioral systems. When infants experience early adversity, they are at risk for difficulties regulating behavior, emotions, and physiology. Parenting interventions have been developed to enhance parental responsiveness, thereby enhancing child outcomes. One such program, Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), is a home visiting intervention designed to enhance parenting nurturance and sensitivity. In this paper, we will consider the importance of parental sensitivity and developmental consequences of sensitive and insensitive care. We will then describe interventions that target parental responsiveness and intervention effectiveness, focusing primarily on ABC. Public policy recommendations related to the importance of parental responsiveness will then be discussed.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, United States. 2 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, United States.

Methods: We searched the electronic databases, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, and ISI Web of Science, through July 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared herbal compounds against a standard medication or placebo for treatment or prevention of radiodermatitis. Results: A total of 16 RCTs involving 1886 patients with breast, head and neck, or unspecified cancer were included. Risk of bias generally was high. Of those, three RCTs with 562 cancer patients (mainly breast cancer) who used Aloe vera to treat radiodermatitis were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant level of heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 95.8). One RCT found positive effects of Aloe vera in reducing the severity of radiodermatitis (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 3.37), whereas another revealed an inverse effect (SMD = -4). Conclusion: At present, there are no herbal compositions that are effective in treating radiodermatitis, with Aloe vera failing to show sufficient efficacy in the meta-analysis.","Affiliations 1 Traditional Medicine and Materia Medica Research Center, and School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 2 Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 3 Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran. 4 Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. 5 Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Evang.

794,REM Sleep: An Unknown Indicator of Sleep Quality,"Standard polysomnographic analysis of sleep has not provided evidence of an objective measure of sleep quality; however, factors such as sleep duration and sleep efficiency are those more consistently associated with the subjective perception of sleep quality. Sleep reduction as currently occurs in our 24/7 society has had a profound impact on sleep quality; the habitual sleep period should fit within what is a limited nighttime window and may not be sufficient to satisfy the whole sleep process; moreover, the use of artificial light during the evening and early night hours can delay and disturb the circadian rhythms, especially affecting REM sleep. The correct phase relationship of the sleep period with the circadian pacemaker is an important factor to guarantee adequate restorative sleep duration and sleep continuity, thus providing the necessary background for a good night's sleep. Due to the fact that REM sleep is controlled by the circadian clock, it can provide a window-like mechanism that defines the termination of the sleep period when there is still the necessity to complete the sleep process (not only wake-related homeostasis) and to meet the circadian end of sleep timing. An adequate amount of REM sleep appears necessary to guarantee sleep continuity, while periodically activating the brain and preparing it for the return to consciousness.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychology, Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, 80122 Caserta, Italy.",Giuseppe Barbato ,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021 Dec 9,"Review,Brain,Circadian Rhythm,Sleep,Sleep Quality*,Sleep, REM*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948586
795,[Placental Locations in Subsequent Pregnancies - A Retrospective Study],"Introduction: Different locations of the placenta are associated with specific risks during pregnancy and labor. Knowledge of the placental location helps to provide better care for the expectant mother and her unborn child. Whereas multiple studies show a higher risk for a recurrent placenta previa, hardly any such data is available for any other placental location. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of distribution of different placental locations and to evaluate correlations between placental locations in subsequent pregnancies. Material and methods: In a retrospective cohort study women with singleton pregnancies ≥ 24 gestational weeks who had at least one ultrasound with identification of the placental location and gave birth to their firstborn and at least one more following child at our hospital between 2007 and 2016 were evaluated. Exclusion criteria were multiple pregnancies, abortions, intrauterine fetal death, and fetal malformations. Placental locations were classified into anterior, posterior, fundal, right, left, and previa. Results: Data of 1657 women were analyzed. The most frequent location was anterior, followed by posterior, fundal and lateral, and previa. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlations in subsequent pregnancies regarding placental locations. Conclusion: Placental locations in subsequent pregnancies seem not to be influenced by previous pregnancies. Therefore no prognosis for placental location can be made concerning future pregnancies.","Affiliation 1 Klinik für Geburtshilfe, UniversitätsSpital Zürich, Zürich, Schweiz.","Corina Egli , Nina Kimmich , Roland Zimmermann , Martina Kreft ",Z Geburtshilfe Neonatol,2021 Feb,"Child,Female,Humans,Placenta / diagnostic imaging*,Placenta Previa / diagnostic imaging,Placenta Previa / epidemiology*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Retrospective Studies,Ultrasonography / methods*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32590876
796,A qualitative exploration of the norms and intentions of nurses toward the clinical use of herbal medicine in Ghana,"Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the norms and intentions of nurses towards the clinical use of herbal medicine. Method: Information on nurses' demographics, norms and intentions was gathered through individual face-to-face interviews. Interviews were analysed using the process of content analysis. Results: Beliefs of the nurses and motivational factors formed their norms. The nurses believed herbal medicine was God-given and was used by their ancestors with good outcomes. Some were self-motivated to serve herbal medicine while others counted on patient's recovery upon the use of herbal medicine to motivate them. Positive and negative intentions were discovered; thus, preparedness and unpreparedness to serve herbal medicine in the future. Conclusions: Though some nurses believe herbal medicine is God-given, used by their ancestors and motivated to serve, others were unwilling because of inadequate training. Training of professional nurses on herbal medicine may improve their negative intentions.","Affiliations 1 School of Nursing, Wisconsin International University College, Ghana, Kumasi, Ghana.

For many thousands of years, herbal products and dietary plants have been prescribed for various diseases by traditional healers. Thus, the aim of this review is to present main herbal products, their source, characteristics, and potential antiviral actions concerning COVID-19. Publications on herbal products related to antiviral effects were searched from different databases, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Medline, Scopus, and PubMed, until August 2021, using English key terms. According to different studies, there are so many important medicinal plants with antiviral activity, which can be used for viral infections or can be prescribed as supportive treatment. lack of information on the safety profile and amount of dose for different diseases is some of the limitations of medicinal plants. herbal medicine can interfere with COVID-19 pathogenesis by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and entry to host cells. Some of the antiviral medicinal plant species are citrus Spp., orange (C.

Our systematic approach included: literature search, purposeful selection of grounded theories regarding parenting a seriously ill child, study summaries, mapping evidence of good parent themes onto structural elements of grounded theory, cross-study comparisons, and theoretical memoing to summarize analytic insights. Twenty-five grounded theory studies from 32 reviewed reports reflected multiple conditions (n=5), countries (n=10) and family members (n=386 families). We report a worked example of the processes used to extend the original good parent themes and detail our processes through one good parent theme. The methods we describe are a promising approach to extend thematic analysis findings and advance thematic expansions toward development of more formal theoretical syntheses.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nursing Science, Professional Practice, and Quality, Children's National Hospital & George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA. 2 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.","Katherine P Kelly , Kathleen A Knafl , Susan Keller , Pamela S Hinds ",West J Nurs Res,2021 Oct,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Child,Grounded Theory,Humans,Parenting*,Parents*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33533322

However, its efficacy is limited. Kampo medicine is a unique medical system that was developed in Japan. In Kampo medicine, herbal medicine is prescribed based on the patient's condition. Therefore, even for functional and motility disorders of the stomach, some herbal medicines are considered as a therapeutic option. Recently, there has been an increase in evidence for the efficacy or the mechanism of herbal medicine for functional and motility disorders of the stomach. Among these, rikkunshito is a well-studied herbal medicine that could be used as an alternative to prokinetics. In this review, we discuss the possibilities of rikkunshito for functional dyspepsia with its prokinetic and non-prokinetic effects and provide an overview of their current use with a focus on their therapeutic mechanism.","Affiliation 1 Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.","Kazumi Inokuchi , Tatsuhiro Masaoka , Takanori Kanai ",Front Pharmacol,2021 Jun 8,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34168558
800,Addressing Parental Adverse Childhood Experiences in the Pediatric Setting,"Parents’ own adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) impact their children’s physical and emotional health. Causal mechanisms are not fully understood but are likely multifactorial, affecting parent resiliency and attachment behaviors, with possible intergenerational transmission. Although universal screening for parental ACEs is controversial, they may be identified during pediatric care. Providers can address parental ACEs by consistently using trauma-informed, healing-centered approaches that acknowledge the impact of trauma and the presence of resilience, promote positive parenting skills, and provide compassionate support universally. When necessary, more targeted interventions may include referral to community social support services and parenting programming. Incorporating a two-generation approach in pediatrics may enhance and support child health and well-being more robustly.","Affiliations 1 Division of General Academic Pediatrics, Children's Mercy Kansas City, 2401 Gillham Road, Kansas City, MO 64109, USA; University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA; University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, KS, USA.

801,Parental Attitudes in Child Maltreatment,"An information-processing approach to maladaptive parenting suggests that high-risk and maltreating parents are likely to hold inaccurate and biased preexisting cognitive schemata about child development and child rearing. Importantly, these schemas, which may include values, beliefs, expectations, and attitudes, are known to influence the way parents perceive and subsequently act toward their children. However, the few studies specifically addressing parental attitudes only considered global maltreatment, not distinguishing abuse from neglect. Moreover, few have considered dual-process models of cognition, relying mostly on the explicit level of parental attitudes that can be prone to various biases. Based on the Social Information Processing (SIP) model of child abuse and neglect, this study examines the association of parents preexisting cognitive schemata, namely explicit and implicit parental attitudes, and child abuse and neglect. A convenience sample of 201 mothers (half with at least one child referred to child protection services) completed a measure of explicit parental attitudes and a speed-accuracy task related to parenting. Abuse and neglect were measured with self-report and professionals-report instruments. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that maladaptive parenting is related with more biased preexisting cognitive schemas, namely attitudes related to parenting, but only for neglect and particularly when reported by professionals. Moreover, the results observed with both the explicit and implicit measures of attitudes were convergent, with mothers presenting more inadequate explicit attitudes also exhibiting an overall lower performance in the implicit attitudes task. This study is likely to contribute to the SIP framework of child abuse and neglect, particularly for the elucidation of the sociocognitive factors underlying maladaptive parenting, while also providing relevant cues for prevention and intervention programs.","Affiliations 1 Iscte-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa, Cis_Iscte, Portugal. 2 CICPSI, Faculdade de Psicologia, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal.","Cláudia Camilo , Margarida Vaz Garrido , Maria Manuela Calheiros ",J Interpers Violence,2022 Mar,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Attitude,Child,Child Abuse* / psychology,Female,Humans,Motivation*,Parenting / psychology,Parents / psychology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32715912

The main aim of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the MIPQ. Method: A total of 271 parents of adolescents completed the MIPQ along with questionnaires about their mindfulness trait, parenting style, and their children's resilience and symptoms of depression. Their adolescent children completed questionnaires about their own depressive symptoms, their perception of their parents' parenting style, and their perceived stress. Results: Factor analyses suggested a two-factor structure corresponding to Being in the Moment with the Child and Mindful Discipline. Moreover, the MIPQ showed good internal consistency and was related to parent's dispositional mindfulness and positive parenting as well as to adolescents' resilience and (negatively) to their depressive symptoms.

806,Neurobiology and Neuroprotective Benefits of Sleep,"Purpose of review: This article outlines the neurocircuitry underlying sleep-wake and circadian physiology with a focus on the fundamental roles that sleep and circadian health play in optimal neurologic function. Recent findings: The foundation of sleep and wake promotion is laid primarily by the ""fast-acting"" neurotransmitters: γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for sleep and glutamate for wake. External to these primary systems are a host of modulatory systems that are characterized by two flip-flop switches of mutually inhibitory neurotransmitter systems that facilitate transitions between wake and sleep as well as non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) and REM sleep. Additional mechanisms are in place to help coordinate the sleep-wake states with environmental, metabolic, and behavioral demands. The complexity of the evolutionarily preserved sleep-wake and circadian systems, the proportion of the day dedicated to the natural sleeping period, as well as the neurocognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration caused by deficient sleep highlight the importance of defining, assessing, and optimizing the sleep health of our patients and ourselves.

807,What is nutritional assessment? A quick guide for critical care clinicians,"Nutritional status is associated with patient outcomes such as length and cost of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. Trained nutrition professionals perform nutritional assessment to evaluate the patient's nutritional status, identify nutritional risk, and plan appropriate nutrition interventions. By being aware of key nutrition risk factors and by using simple methods to assess muscle stores, which may be depleted even if the patient is overweight or obese, other members of the healthcare team can help to identify who is at nutritional risk and who may be malnourished. This is helpful in identifying which patients should be referred promptly to a dietitian for appropriate nutrition therapy to improve outcomes.","Affiliation 1 Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Missenden Road, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

808,Prioritizing nutrition during recovery from critical illness,"Purpose of review: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) often experience a significant decline in nutritional status due to a combination of the physiologic response to critical illness and insufficient calorie intake. The majority of research related to nutrition interventions for this population focuses on nutrition support during the acute phase. Minimal attention is given to the nutritional status of ICU patients during the recovery phase. This review will describe calorie intake when ICU care ends, provide an overview of barriers that limit intake, and possible interventions to improve nutritional status. Recent findings: Current evidence suggests patients are consuming < 60% of calorie requirements after extubation and ICU discharge. This inadequate calorie intake may exacerbate weight loss and muscle and fat wasting. Physiologic, physical, and cognitive manifestations of critical illness can lead to multiple issues that cause poor intake. Possible interventions to improve calorie intake include a patient-centered approach that utilizes oral nutrition supplements and enteral nutrition. Summary: Consuming adequate caloric intake in the recovery phase of critical illness is essential for rehabilitation. A systematic, patient centered approach that includes close monitoring of calorie and protein and timely interventions may be the best method to improve overall intake.","Affiliations 1 Department of Food and Nutrition, Rush University Medical Center. 2 Department of Clinical Nutrition, College of Health Sciences, 600 S Paulina St, Office 737B, Chicago, Illinois, USA.","Morgan K Nienow , Courtney E Susterich , Sarah J Peterson ",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,2021 Mar 1,"Review,Critical Care,Critical Illness*,Energy Intake,Humans,Intensive Care Units,Nutritional Requirements,Nutritional Status*,Nutritional Support",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33394715

810,Cardioautonomic control in healthy singleton and twin pregnancies,"In conjunction with significant cardiovascular adaptation, changes in cardioautonomic balance, specifically greater sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal, are considered normal adaptations to healthy singleton pregnancy. Cardiovascular adaptation to twin pregnancy is more profound than that of singleton pregnancies; however, the changes in cardioautonomic control during multifetal gestation are unknown. To address this gap, beat-by-beat blood pressure (photoplethysmography) and heart rate (lead II electrocardiogram) were measured continuously in 25 twin pregnancies and 25 singleton pregnancies (matched for age, prepregnancy body mass index, and gestational age) during 10 min of rest. Data extracted from a 3- to 5-min period were used to analyze heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), cardiovagal baroreflex gain, and cardiac intervals as indicators of cardioautonomic control. Independent t tests were used to determine statistical differences between groups (α = 0.05), and the false rate discovery was determined to adjust for multiple comparisons. Resting heart rate was greater in twin compared with singleton pregnancies (91 ± 10 vs. 81 ± 10 beats/min; P = 0.001), but blood pressure was not different. Individuals with twin pregnancies had lower HRV, evidenced by lower standard deviation of R-R intervals (32 ± 11 vs. 47 ± 18 ms; P = 0.001), total power (1,035 ± 810 vs. 1,945 ± 1,570 ms2; P = 0.004), and high frequency power (224 ± 262 vs. 810 ± 806 ms2; P < 0.001) compared with singleton pregnancies. There were no differences in cardiac intervals, BPV, and cardiovagal baroreflex gain between groups. Our findings suggest that individuals with twin pregnancies have greater sympathetic and lower parasympathetic contributions to heart rate and that cardiac, but not vascular, autonomic control is impacted during twin compared with singleton pregnancy.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Individuals with healthy twin pregnancies had lower overall heart rate variability compared with those with singleton pregnancies at similar gestational ages. These results suggest a greater sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic contribution to cardiac control in twin pregnancies. Baseline heart rate was elevated, while arterial pressure and spontaneous cardiovagal baroreflex gain were not different between groups. This was result of the upward resetting of the cardiovagal baroreflex during healthy twin pregnancy, thus maintaining arterial pressure.","Affiliations 1 Physical Activity and Diabetes Laboratory, Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport and Recreation, Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Alberta Diabetes Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 2 Departments of Medicine and Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 3 Momentum Health and Wellness, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 4 Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Fetal and Neonatal Cardiology Program, Women's and Children Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 5 Neurovascular Health Laboratory, Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.","Victoria L Meah , Miranda L Kimber , Rshmi Khurana , Rachelle Howse , Lisa K Hornberger , Craig D Steinback , Margie H Davenport ",J Appl Physiol (1985),2021 Apr 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Autonomic Nervous System,Baroreflex*,Blood Pressure,Female,Heart Rate,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33356983

812,Herbal Medicine for Glioblastoma: Current and Future Prospects,"Background: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and devastating tumours of the central nervous system with short survival time. Glioblastoma usually shows fast cell proliferation and invasion of normal brain tissue causing poor prognosis. The present standard of care in patients with glioblastoma includes surgery followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, these approaches are not sufficient to lead a favorable prognosis and survival rates. As the current approaches do not provide a long-term benefit in those patients, new alternative treatments including natural compounds, have drawn attention. Due to their natural origin, they are associated with minimum cellular toxicity towards normal cells and it has become one of the most attractive approaches to treat tumours by natural compounds or phytochemicals. Objective: In the present review, the role of natural compounds or phytochemicals in the treatment of glioblastoma describing their efficacy on various aspects of glioblastoma pathophysiology such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cellular signaling pathways, chemoresistance and their role in combinatorial therapeutic approaches was described. Methods: Peer-reviewed literature was extracted using Pubmed, EMBASE Ovid and Google Scholar to be reviewed in the present article. Conclusion: Preclinical data available in the literature suggest that phytochemicals hold immense potential to be translated into treatment modalities. However, further clinical studies with conclusive results are required to implement phytochemicals in treatment modalities.","Affiliations 1 Department of Molecular Biology, Beykoz Institute of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Bezmialem Vakif University, Yalıköy Mahallesi, Beykoz, Istanbul, Turkey 2 Department of Neurosurgery, Bezmialem Vakif University Medical School, Vatan Street, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey","Imran Khan , Sadaf Mahfooz , Mustafa A Hatiboglu ",Med Chem,2020,"Review,Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic / chemistry,Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic / pharmacology*,Biological Products / chemistry,Biological Products / pharmacology*,Central Nervous System Neoplasms / drug therapy*,Central Nervous System Neoplasms / pathology,Drug Resistance, Neoplasm / drug effects,Glioblastoma / drug therapy*,Glioblastoma / pathology,Herbal Medicine*,Humans,Phytochemicals / chemistry,Phytochemicals / pharmacology*,Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic,Biological Products,Phytochemicals",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32000653

814,Is a Surrogate Pregnancy a High-Risk Pregnancy?,"Importance: As assisted reproductive technology has advanced, there has been an increase in gestational carriers/surrogate pregnancies. Information is needed to determine if these pregnancies are high-risk pregnancies and should be managed by maternal fetal medicine or if they are not high risk and should be cared for by residency-trained obstetricians and gynecologists. Objective: In this review of the literature, we explore whether surrogate pregnancies should be classified as high-risk pregnancies and managed by subspecialists. Evidence acquisition, results: Our literature search discovered 28 relevant studies that evaluated surrogate pregnancy and pregnancy complications/outcomes. We learned that the overall risk by using artificial reproductive technology and risks for hypertension, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, low birth weight neonate, fetal anomalies, and stillbirth did not seem to increase maternal/perinatal risk to the level where a subspecialist was required for the inclusive management of a gestational surrogate. Given that the ideal gestational carrier is healthy, has previously had a term pregnancy, has a single embryo implanted, and has had no more than 3 prior cesarean deliveries, these pregnancies should be lower-risk pregnancies. Conclusions: We recommend that close monitoring and high index of suspicion should be maintained for complications, but care for the surrogate pregnancy can be accomplished by a residency-trained obstetrician-gynecologist. Relevance: An uncomplicated surrogate pregnancy can be managed by a residency-trained obstetrician-gynecologist and does not need to be managed by high-risk obstetric subspecialists.","Affiliations 1 Resident. 2 Professor. 3 Assistant Professor. 4 Fellow, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Arkansas for the Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR. 5 Independent Researcher, Retired US Navy, Temecula, CA.","Patricia Amorado , Everett F Magann , Amy M Phillips , Dean M Moutos , Julie R Whittington , Dawn S Hughes , Jack H Klausen ",Obstet Gynecol Surv,2021 May,"Review,Cesarean Section,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, High-Risk*,Premature Birth*,Stillbirth",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34032862

Four malnutrition diagnostic tools are currently in use today in adults: Subjective Global Assessment, the Mini Nutritional Assessment, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition malnutrition consensus characteristics, and the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition criteria. The aim of this article is to provide sufficient background of these methodologies to assist clinicians in choosing their approach in diagnosing malnutrition. There is substantial overlap between the criteria included in these malnutrition diagnostic approaches. A desired goal is to identify a core data set in order to evaluate malnutrition prevalence globally and to assess the impact of nutrition interventions on nutrition and clinical outcomes.","Affiliations 1 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, Silver Spring, MD, USA. 2 Mt Carmel East Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA. 3 Department of Nutrition, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.","Ainsley Malone , Kris M Mogensen ",Nutr Clin Pract,2022 Feb,"Review,Adult,Dietetics*,Humans,Malnutrition* / diagnosis,Malnutrition* / epidemiology,Malnutrition* / therapy,Nutrition Assessment,Nutritional Status,Parenteral Nutrition",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936131
816,Genetic and Genomic Advances in Developmental Models: Applications for Nutrition Research,"There is increasing appreciation that dietary components influence and interact with genes important to metabolism. How such influences impact developmental regulation and programming or risks of chronic diseases remains unclear. Nutrition is recognized to affect development and chronic diseases, but our understanding about how genes essential to nutrient metabolism regulate development and impact risks of these diseases remains unclear. Historically, mammalian models, especially rodents such as rats and mice, have been the primary models used for nutrition and developmental nutrition science, although their complexity and relatively slow rate of development often compromise rapid progress in resolving fundamental, genetic-related questions. Accordingly, the objective of this review is to highlight the opportunities for developmental models in the context of uncovering the function of gene products that are relevant to human nutrition and provide the scientific bases for these opportunities. We present recent studies in zebrafish related to obesity as applications of developmental models in nutritional science. Although the control of external factors and dependent variables, such as nutrition, can be a challenge, suggestions for standardizations related to diet are made to improve consistency in findings between laboratories. The review also highlights the need for standardized diets across different developmental models, which could improve consistency in findings across laboratories. Alternative and developmental animal models have advantages and largely untapped potential for the advancement of nutrigenomics and nutritionally relevant research areas.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nutritional Sciences, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA. 2 Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. 3 Department of Nutrition, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA. 4 Department of Biology and Microbiology, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD, USA.","Winyoo Chowanadisai , Matthew D Hart , Morgan D Strong , David M Graham , Robert B Rucker , Brenda J Smith , Carl L Keen , Mark A Messerli ",Adv Nutr,2020 Jul 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Animals,Diet,Genomics,Humans,Mice,Nutrigenomics*,Nutritional Status,Rats,Zebrafish*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32135011
817,"Iodine nutrition: Disorders, monitoring and policies","Iodine is an essential mineral nutrient and an integral component of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency is typically associated with goiter, but can have more serious health implications. Adequate iodine status is important for normal brain development. Iodine deficiency in utero or in early life can cause severe neurological and cognitive impairment. Over the last three decades, global efforts have reduced the prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) in many areas of the world with implementation of nutrition policies and programs such as ""salt"" iodization. However, in a number of areas iodine deficiency is still widespread. Iodine deficiency in remote regions with high poverty will be more difficult to eradicate. Efforts to eliminate IDD in affected areas and sustaining successful iodine programs will be a priority given the substantial public health and economic benefits. A key component will be periodic monitoring of population iodine status to ensure sufficient intakes and the absence of excessive intakes. Median urinary iodine concentration (UIC), a validated biomarker for assessing population iodine status, will facilitate monitoring. Research validating ""usual"" UIC for use in combination with the Estimated Average Requirement cut-point method will expand its utility and allow accurate determination of the prevalence of inadequate intakes in populations. Further research on the development of biomarkers for assessment of individual iodine status for routine patient care will be important.","Affiliation 1 Nutrition Research Division, Bureau of Nutritional Sciences, Food Directorate, Health Products and Food Branch, Health Canada, Sir Frederick G.

818,Anti-cancer properties of specific Chinese herbal medicines for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment,"Aims: This essay explores the anti-cancer activity of specific Chinese herbal medicines to clarify how effective Chinese herbal medicine is used for handling hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Literature form publica domain were studied and an analysis of anti-cancer activity of specific Chinese herbal medicines is presented in this review. Results: Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most dangerous malignant tumors in the world. The operative diagnosis of liver cancer remains a significant challenge. Although surgery tissue resection is encouraging, a high risk of recurrence and metastasis, illustrating disease-related mortality is desperately required to enhance postoperative preventive and therapeutic clinical procedures. The almost only effective clinical intervention seems to be developing advanced targeted therapies such as sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma patients, but there is little research in this field. Because their preventative/therapeutic properties strengthen Chinese herbal medicinal compounds, they are deemed relevant to the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: Chinese herbal medicine derivates provide multifaceted, orientated and orchestrated therapy, making it an ideal candidate for inhibiting hepatocellular tumor production and metastasis.","Affiliations 1 Pharmacy, Qingdao Island Central Hospital. 2 Department of Pharmacy, Huangdao district Chinese Medicine Hospital, Qingdao. 3 Qingdao West Coast New Area Health Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Brigade.","Zang Ping , Xue Jun , Wang Yan , Zhang Jun ",Eur J Integr Med,2020 Oct 3,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33042292
819,"An Anti-Wrinkle Diet: Nutritional Strategies to Combat Oxidation, Inflammation and Glycation","There is growing awareness of the complex link between nutrition and skin. In the last few decades, our understanding of this link has grown significantly with research findings from multiple laboratory, animal, and human studies. From the impact of diet on clinical features of aging skin, to documentation of the biochemical and histologic changes that occur, our understanding of this link continues to expand and evolve. In this paper, we review the research on the impact of diet on skin aging. A number of long-term observational population studies have documented that healthier diets are linked to fewer signs of skin aging. Animal and laboratory studies have elucidated the biochemical processes that play a large role in the development of these clinical findings. A number of studies have also reported on the role of specific dietary compounds in impacting these processes, whether by combating or potentiating these forces. This body of research serves as guidance in recommending nutritional strategies that can combat the skin aging forces of oxidation, inflammation, and glycation.","Affiliations 1 McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA 2 Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA 3 Katta Dermatology, Bellaire, TX, USA 4 Rice University, Houston, TX, USA","Rajani Katta , Ariadna Sanchez , Evelyne Tantry ",Skin Therapy Lett,2020 Mar,"Review,Animals,Diet*,Glycosylation,Humans,Inflammation / diet therapy,Inflammation / pathology,Nutritional Status / physiology*,Oxidation-Reduction,Skin / metabolism,Skin Aging / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32196147

821,Multiple Gestations and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy: What Do We Know?,"Purpose of review: The occurrence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) including gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia is proportional to the number of fetuses: singletons 6.5%, twins 12.7%, and triplets 20.0%. Literature on HDP in multifetal gestation is sparse compared with singletons. We aim to summarize the current evidence on HDP, specifically in twins. Recent findings: HDP occurs more frequently, at an earlier gestational age, and can present more severely and atypically in twin pregnancies. HDP in twins carries a higher risk of maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality including renal failure, stroke, cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, placental abruption, cesarean delivery, fetal growth restriction, and iatrogenic preterm delivery. Low-dose aspirin (60-150 mg) should be initiated in all multifetal pregnancies to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. To improve outcomes and reduce inherent risks associated with multiple gestations, twins should be managed as high-risk pregnancies, and different from singletons.","Affiliations 1 Maternal Fetal Medicine Division, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. 2 Maternal Fetal Medicine Division, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. szymanski.linda@mayo.edu.","Kavita Narang , Linda M Szymanski ",Curr Hypertens Rep,2020 Nov 18,"Review,Eclampsia*,Female,Humans,Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced* / epidemiology,Infant, Newborn,Pre-Eclampsia*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, Twin,Premature Birth*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33210199

823,Coronavirus management and control: Nutrition and alternative medicines,"Background: In late December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2, originated in Wuhan Province, the People's Republic of China (PRC). The rapid and highly infectious virus quickly spread around the country and has become a global pandemic. Thousands of people have been infected, and have died. Scientists around the world are working on the vaccine; however, an effective cure is yet to be developed. Aims: Search to be made on some alternative antiviral components from the rich sources of traditional herbal medicine in India as well as in the PRC. Here we discuss them with references. Methods: The knowledge gained from the literature search of antiviral known herbal products or Ayurvedic medicines that used to be applied against any viral or bacterial infections in the past, may be considered for deployment against COVID-19, and may be rewarded. Results: Many medicinal compounds are extracted from plants and have led to drug discovery. Similarly, plant products and their analogues have been employed as an early line of defense against COVID-19. Conclusion: Research into ethnobotany, phytochemistry, plant physiology and ecology may be important in protecting the global population from current and future pandemics.","Affiliations 1 St. John's University, Queens, NY, USA. 2 Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.","Smita Guha , Ashok Chakraborty ",Nutr Health,2021 Apr 15,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33858237

To date, there is only scarce data evaluating nutrition among CrossFit training and they mostly focus on selected nutritional interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive study was the assessment of dietary intake and nutritional status in a selected group of CrossFit-trained participants. The study consisted of 62 CrossFit athletes (31 men and 31 women, aged 31.0 ± 5.2 and 30.0 ± 4.3 years, respectively). Body composition was analyzed by electrical bioimpedance. Dietary intake was assessed using a standardized 3-day food record. Body fat percentage for females and males was 20.3 ± 4.3% and 13.7 ± 3.3% respectively. The energy intake in the diet was lower (~1700 kcal in women and ~2300 kcal in men) than the recommended demand. Moreover, low consumption of carbohydrates was stated, as well as an inadequate intake of folate, vitamin E (in women), and minerals, such as Fe and Ca (in women). The energy, carbohydrate, iron, and calcium intake in the CrossFit participants' diet was too low in comparison to recommendations. It seems justified to educate athletes and coaches about nutritional habits, and individual energy and nutrients requirements.","Affiliations 1 Department of Food and Nutrition, Poznan University of Physical Education, 61-871 Poznań, Poland. 2 Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Poznan University of Physical Education, 61-871 Poznań, Poland. 3 Institute of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, Poznan University of Life Sciences, 61-871 Poznań, Poland.","Anna Gogojewicz , Ewa Śliwicka , Krzysztof Durkalec-Michalski ",Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020 Jul 2,"Adult,Athletes,Diet*,Dietary Carbohydrates,Dietary Proteins,Energy Intake*,Exercise*,Female,Humans,Male,Nutritional Requirements,Nutritional Status*,Dietary Carbohydrates,Dietary Proteins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32630749

The purpose of this review was to establish the prevalence of herbal medicine use among patients with cancer, across various geographical settings and patient characteristics (age and gender categories). Methods: Electronic databases that were searched for data published, from January 2000 to January 2020, were Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, Embase, and African Index Medicus. Eligible studies reporting prevalence estimates of herbal medicine use amongst cancer patients were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Studies were grouped by World Bank region and income groups. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore source of heterogeneity. Results: In total, 155 studies with data for 809,065 participants (53.95% female) met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled prevalence of the use of herbal medicine among patients with cancer was 22% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18%-25%), with the highest prevalence estimates for Africa (40%, 95% CI: 23%-58%) and Asia (28%, 95% CI: 21%-35%). The pooled prevalence estimate was higher across low- and middle-income countries (32%, 95% CI: 23%-42%) and lower across high-income countries (17%, 95% CI: 14%-21%). Higher pooled prevalence estimates were found for adult patients with cancer (22%, 95% CI: 19%-26%) compared with children with cancer (18%, 95% CI: 11%-27%) and for female patients (27%, 95% CI: 19%-35%) compared with males (17%, 95% CI: 1%-47%).

829,Clinical Course of Chronic Pancreatitis During Pregnancy and its Effect on Maternal and Fetal Outcomes,"Introduction: There are limited data on the effect of chronic pancreatitis (CP) on pregnancy outcomes and vice versa. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical trajectory of CP during pregnancy and its effect on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: All female patients of child-bearing age (≥15 years) diagnosed with CP were studied from January 2004 to July 2019. The change in frequency of painful episodes was assessed before, during, and after pregnancy. Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between pregnant women (early onset) and women presenting with CP after completion of all pregnancies (late onset). Results: Of 187 women with CP, pregnancy outcomes and clinical course were assessed in 99 patients. The frequency of painful exacerbations was significantly lower during pregnancy compared with prepregnancy and postpregnancy periods (P < 0.001). The median pain score decreased significantly to 0 (0-2) during pregnancy from 3 (0-6) before conception and increased to 4 (0-8) after pregnancy (P = 0.002). Women with early onset CP (n = 57) had their first child later and had fewer pregnancies compared with those with late onset CP (n = 42). There was no difference in maternal outcomes such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preterm delivery, and fetal outcomes such as abortion, low birth weight, and still birth between the groups. There was no reported congenital anomaly. Discussion: Younger patients with CP had later and fewer pregnancies, but there was no increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The clinical course of CP was usually benign during pregnancy with decreased frequency and severity of pain.","Affiliations 1 Department of Gastroenterology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. 3 Department of Biostatistics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.","Soumya Jagannath Mahapatra , Shallu Midha , Gadella Varun Teja , Tanmay Vajpai , Nilanchali Singh , Sushree Monika Sahoo , Shivam Pandey , Anshuman Elhence , Rahul Sethia , Pramod Kumar Garg ",Am J Gastroenterol,2021 Mar 1,"Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Pancreatitis, Chronic / diagnosis*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / diagnosis*,Pregnancy Outcome,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33657043

831,The concept of alimentation and transdisciplinary research,"Although the term 'alimentation' has existed in the English language since the late 16th century, its use is infrequent. In Latin languages, particularly French, 'alimentation' conveys a holistic notion of the process by which humans produce, procure, prepare, share, indulge in, and digest their foods. Thus, the concept of alimentation encompasses and integrates human, technological, sociocultural, and environmental domains. This article delves into the origins of the term 'alimentation' and its use in the foreign scientific literature, and particularly in the social sciences. Unlike 'food and nutrition', alimentation provides a broader frame for the grand challenges of what, how, and with whom we eat. This approach should lead to transdisciplinary research (TDR) interfacing several knowledge domains (e.g., environmental, technological, socio-cultural, nutritional, etc.) and involving key stakeholders. Possible outcomes of TDR in alimentation are inspiring and meaningful collaborations, innovative methodologies for integrating knowledge, transformative learning of researchers, enriched educational experiences for students, focused community action, and improved public policy. The term 'alimentation' is appropriately used in French and other Latin languages. Alimentation embraces human, technological, sociocultural, and environmental issues This holistic concept views agriculture, food, and nutrition as parts of a broader process Transdisciplinary research interfaces several dimensions of food and eating. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.","Affiliation 1 Department of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.",José M Aguilera ,J Sci Food Agric,2021 Mar 30,"Review,Agriculture*,Food Technology*,Humans,Interdisciplinary Research*,Nutritional Sciences*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32949020

Study design: Through online crowdsourcing, an innovative research methodology to create an online community to serve as a research sample, 79 parents of young children with CHD responded to questions about parenting during hospitalisation via private social networking site. Responses were analysed using qualitative research methods. Results: Three broad themes were identified: (1) establishing a bond with my baby, (2) asserting the parental role, and (3) coping with fear and uncertainty. Parents value provider support in restoring normalcy to the parenting experience during infant hospitalisation. Conclusions: Care teams can support parenting during infant hospitalisation by promoting parents' roles as primary caretakers and decision-makers and attending to the emotional impact of infant hospitalisation on the family.","Affiliations 1 Division of Behavioral Health, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, USA. 2 Center for Research in Education and Social Policy, Department of Human Development and Family Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA. 3 Center for Healthcare Delivery Science, Nemours Children's Health System, Wilmington, DE, USA. 4 Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. 5 Sisters by Heart, El Segundo, CA, USA. 6 Herma Heart Center, Children's Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA. 7 Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA. 8 Department of Pediatrics, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University,Philadelphia, PA, USA. 9 Nemours Cardiac Center, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE, USA.","Colette Gramszlo , Allison Karpyn , Jennifer Christofferson , Linda G McWhorter , Abigail C Demianczyk , Stacey L Lihn , Jena Tanem , Sinai Zyblewski , Elizabeth Lucey Boyle , Anne E Kazak , Erica Sood ",Cardiol Young,2020 Oct,"Child,Child, Preschool,Fathers*,Female,Hospitalization,Humans,Infant,Male,Mothers,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32758310
833,Parental characteristics and offspring mental health and related outcomes: a systematic review of genetically informative literature,"Various parental characteristics, including psychiatric disorders and parenting behaviours, are associated with offspring mental health and related outcomes in observational studies. The application of genetically informative designs is crucial to disentangle the role of genetic and environmental factors (as well as gene-environment correlation) underlying these observations, as parents provide not only the rearing environment but also transmit 50% of their genes to their offspring. This article first provides an overview of behavioural genetics, matched-pair, and molecular genetics designs that can be applied to investigate parent-offspring associations, whilst modelling or accounting for genetic effects. We then present a systematic literature review of genetically informative studies investigating associations between parental characteristics and offspring mental health and related outcomes, published since 2014. The reviewed studies provide reliable evidence of genetic transmission of depression, criminal behaviour, educational attainment, and substance use. These results highlight that studies that do not use genetically informative designs are likely to misinterpret the mechanisms underlying these parent-offspring associations. After accounting for genetic effects, several parental characteristics, including parental psychiatric traits and parenting behaviours, were associated with offspring internalising problems, externalising problems, educational attainment, substance use, and personality through environmental pathways. Overall, genetically informative designs to study intergenerational transmission prove valuable for the understanding of individual differences in offspring mental health and related outcomes, and mechanisms of transmission within families.","Affiliations 1 Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. e.shahid@ucl.ac.uk. 2 Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London, London, UK. e.shahid@ucl.ac.uk. 3 Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 4 Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centres, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 5 Child Health Research Centre, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. 6 Child and Youth Mental Health Service, Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.","Eshim S Jami , Anke R Hammerschlag , Meike Bartels , Christel M Middeldorp ",Transl Psychiatry,2021 Apr 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Systematic Review,Child of Impaired Parents*,Humans,Mental Health,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795643

The effects of oral nutrition supplements (ONS) on nutritional intake, nutritional status, and cognitive and physical outcomes in older persons with dementia were evaluated. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched in December 2017, and this was repeated in May 2019. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Analysis (PRISMA) checklist was used. Papers were considered if they presented experimental clinical trials using oral nutritional supplements to persons diagnosed with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, and conducted in hospitals, nursing homes or homes. Results: We included ten articles reporting nine clinical trials. A total of 407 persons with dementia were included, of whom 228 used ONS for 7 to 180 days. Nutritional intake improved by 201 to 600 kcal/day. Energy intake from ordinary foods was not affected, thus ONS improved the persons daily intake of energy and protein. Body weight, muscle mass, and nutritional biomarkers in blood improved in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. No effects on cognition or physical outcomes were observed. Conclusion: ONS increases the intake of energy and protein and improves nutritional status in persons with dementia; however, RCTs with longer intervention periods are needed to investigate the impact on cognitive and functional outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Mohn Nutrition Research Laboratory, Centre for Nutrition, Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Postboks 7804, 5020 Bergen.

As crude drugs and Kampo extracts are derived from natural products and have the characteristics of traditional medicines, some degree of variation has been experienced during their long-term use, which is one of the crucial differences from chemical drugs. The Japanese Pharmacopoeia Committee on Crude Drugs promotes standardization of the JP by reflecting the actual Japanese market situation. This review explains the characteristics of natural and traditional medicines in crude drug-related items, the JP drafting process and points to be noted, and the significance of listing in the JP.","Affiliation 1 National Institute of Health Sciences, Division of Pharmacognosy, Phytochemistry and Narcotics.",Takashi Hakamatsuka ,Yakugaku Zasshi,2020,"Review,Complex Mixtures / standards*,Drugs, Chinese Herbal / standards*,Japan,Medicine, Kampo,Pharmacopoeias as Topic / standards*,Complex Mixtures,Drugs, Chinese Herbal",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475928
838,Maternal Pregnancy Intention and Developmental Outcomes in Brazilian Preschool-Aged Children,"Objective: This study aims to characterize the association between maternal pregnancy intention and socioemotional developmental outcomes in a Brazilian sample of preschool-aged children. Methods: Data from children aged 4 to 5 years and their primary caregivers in Embu das Artes, a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo, were collected in 2016. Maternal pregnancy intention was defined as intended or unintended, which was then further stratified as mistimed or unwanted. Outcomes included socioemotional developmental delay, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and school readiness. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for unadjusted and inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) analyses using 2-level (intended vs unintended) and 3-level (intended vs mistimed vs unwanted) exposure definitions. Results: Of 1,034 total mothers, 40.7% reported their pregnancy as intended, 46.0% as mistimed, and 13.4% as unwanted. In both unadjusted and IPWRA analyses comparing intended and unintended pregnancies, all associations failed to reach statistical significance. In the IPWRA analysis using the 3-level exposure definition, unwanted pregnancies were associated with higher risk of socioemotional developmental delay (RR = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.28) and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing behaviors (RR = 1.11, 95% CI, 1.00-1.22), compared with intended pregnancies. Conclusion: There was higher risk of poor child outcomes among unwanted compared with intended pregnancies, whereas mistimed pregnancies were not associated with poor outcomes. Further research using standardized definitions of pregnancy intention along with targeted interventions that increase access to family planning services and counseling for parents of children born after unintended pregnancies is needed.","Affiliations 1 Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD. 2 Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD. 3 Department of Psychiatry, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. 4 Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY.","Minyoung Jang , Andrea R Molino , Marcos V Ribeiro , Marília Mariano , Silvia S Martins , Sheila C Caetano , Pamela J Surkan ",J Dev Behav Pediatr,2021 Dec 1,"Brazil,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Intention*,Mothers,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned,Pregnancy, Unwanted*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859123

840,The lived experience of women with a high-risk pregnancy: A phenomenology investigation,"Background: Pregnancy is a time of transformation, hope, expectation, and worry for women and their families - none more so than when the pregnancy is at-risk. The objective of this study was to describe the lived experience of women during high-risk pregnancy. Methods: This qualitative investigation utilized a hermeneutic phenomenology study. The study was conducted in a public health center in a large urban area in southeast Iran. Purposive sampling of 20 women with a high-risk pregnancy. Participants included both nulligravid and multigravid women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with varied medical conditions. Data collection used face-to-face interview with transcribed data analyzed using Braun and Clarke's six stage thematic analysis approach. Results: Four themes were extracted and included challenge of family in high-risk pregnancy, challenge of anticipation for motherhood, and challenges for future pregnancies, and challenge of adaptation. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that women with a high-risk pregnancy struggle to adapt with burdens related to successful maternal role attainment and family functioning. Fears about pregnancy outcome and future pregnancies are dominant.","Affiliations 1 Midwifery Department, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Iran.

841,Measuring Food Culture: a Tool for Public Health Practice,"Purpose of review: Food culture is a ubiquitous aspect of all societies. This review provides an overview of methods for measuring food culture, and emphasizes the importance of these measures not just for description, but also for strengthening public health practice, primarily through the development of better interventions; to monitor and evaluate changes in diet and nutrition; and for the development of strategies for sustainability and dissemination. Recent findings: Food culture measurement has enriched public health practice through its use of myriad approaches, including interviews, cultural domain analysis, visual methods, observation, time allocation studies, focus groups and community workshops, household studies, and textual analysis. Food culture measurement is essential for public health practice related to food and nutrition, and can lead to, among other outcomes, improved implementation research in nutrition, understanding household dynamics that impact nutritional outcomes, innovative textual analysis to identify food culture through language, and the selection of interventions conveyed through multiple strategies, including digital means, such as via social media.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Independencia 1027, 8380453, Santiago, Chile. rkanter@med.uchile.cl. 2 Department of International Health, Center for Human Nutrition, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.","Rebecca Kanter , Joel Gittelsohn ",Curr Obes Rep,2020 Dec,"Review,Culture*,Diet / ethnology*,Food*,Humans,Nutritional Sciences / methods*,Public Health Practice*,Sustainable Development",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33128691
842,Effects of individual-oriented relationship education for parents: A randomized controlled trial,"Individual-oriented relationship education aims to support healthy relationship development for singles, and provides flexibility for couples when only one member is available or willing to attend. While quasi-experimental studies have shown some benefits for those who attended relationship education individually, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted for individual-oriented RE. Moreover, it is not clear how relationship education benefits the co-parenting relationship when only one parent attends. Thus, this paper presents the results of a randomized controlled trial, with a wait-list control group, for a sub-sample of parents (N = 322) who participated in a 6-month trial of individual-oriented relationship education utilizing Prevention and Relationship Education Program's (PREP) Within My Reach (WMR) curriculum. Results indicated statistically significant, small, positive intervention effects on parent-child relationships 3 months after random assignment. However, no other treatment effects were detected for parents. We also found no statistically significant differences in the rate of change over the 6-month study period between treatment and wait-list control parents. There was a statistically significant effect for time, indicating that all enrolled parents in the study reported significant positive growth on emotion regulation, positive encouragement, parent-child relationships, and parental adjustment. We discuss implications for relationship education programming, as well as evaluating outcomes in future studies.

843,Occurrence and analysis of mycotoxins in domestic Chinese herbal medicines,"For time immemorial, Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have been widely used in China for disease treatment and promotion of general well-being. However, in recent years, many studies have shown that mycotoxins produced by fungi could contaminate CHMs due to unfavourable pre- or post-harvest conditions, raising major concern for consumer safety. At present, there is a significant focus on developing novel mycotoxin detection methods for analysing CHMs, and numerous studies have aimed to determine which kinds of raw herbal materials are most susceptible to mycotoxin contamination. In this review, we focus on recent advances in understanding and detection of mycotoxins in domestic raw herbal materials and related products from 2000 to 2018. Aspects of mycotoxin contamination of CHMs covered in this review include common mycotoxin contaminants in CHMs, maximum mycotoxin residue limits, analytical methods for mycotoxin detection and their applications and limitations, as well as a brief discussion of the trends in ongoing research.","Affiliations 1 Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China. 2 Pharmacy College, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China. 3 School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.","Lu Qin , Jia-Yi Jiang , Lei Zhang , Xiao-Wen Dou , Zhen Ouyang , Li Wan , Mei-Hua Yang ",Mycology,2020 Feb 20,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32923021
844,Nutrition Effects on Childhood Executive Control,"Greater abilities for executive control in childhood have long-term benefits for academic and vocational success. Therefore, lifestyle approaches with the potential to support executive control in childhood stand to have long-term implications not only for physical but also for cognitive health. Nutrition plays a fundamental role in brain structure and function. While a considerable amount of literature demonstrates the detrimental effects of deficiencies in essential nutrients, comparatively little is known is about the role of overall diet quality in promoting executive control among children without diagnosed nutrient deficiencies. Emerging evidence provides preliminary support for the importance of key nutrients (e.g., water, dietary fiber, carotenoids, and choline) that contribute to diet quality. This article represents a brief narrative review that aims to highlight the importance of habitual diet quality for executive control in childhood. Additional research is needed to continue developing the evidence base for diet patterns and nutrients that preferentially support executive control during childhood. This is an important goal given that nutritional recommendations for children's cognitive function are absent from the US dietary guidelines, making the endeavor to develop the evidence base for diet patterns and nutrients that preferentially support executive control during childhood all the more important.","Affiliations 1 Division of Nutritional Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA. 2 Division of Nutritional Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA, nakhan2@illinois.edu. 3 Department of Kinesiology and Community Health, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA, nakhan2@illinois.edu. 4 Neuroscience Program, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, USA, nakhan2@illinois.edu.","Nathaniel Willis , Naiman A Khan ",Nestle Nutr Inst Workshop Ser,2020,"Review,Child,Diet,Executive Function*,Humans,Life Style,Nutrients,Nutritional Status*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33166986
845,Lasia spinosa Chemical Composition and Therapeutic Potential: A Literature-Based Review,"Lasia spinosa (L.) is used ethnobotanically for the treatment of various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation of the lungs, bleeding cough, hemorrhoids, intestinal diseases, stomach pain, and uterine cancer. This review is aimed at summarizing phytochemistry and pharmacological data with their molecular mechanisms of action. A search was performed in databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using the keywords: ""Lasia spinosa,"" then combined with ""ethnopharmacological use,"" ""phytochemistry,"" and ""pharmacological activity."" This updated review included studies with in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments with compounds of known concentration and highlighted pharmacological mechanisms. The research results showed that L. spinosa contains many important nutritional and phytochemical components such as alkanes, aldehydes, alkaloids, carotenoids, flavonoids, fatty acids, ketones, lignans, phenolics, terpenoids, steroids, and volatile oil with excellent bioactivity. The importance of this review lies in the fact that scientific pharmacological evidence supports the fact that the plant has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antidiarrheal, antihelminthic, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and antinociceptive effects, while protecting the gastrointestinal system and reproductive. Regarding future toxicological and safety data, more research is needed, including studies on human subjects. In light of these data, L. spinosa can be considered a medicinal plant with effective bioactives for the adjuvant treatment of various diseases in humans.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmacy, Life Science Faculty, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj 8100, Bangladesh. 2 Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Arturo Prat, Avda.

847,Fearlessness and low social affiliation as unique developmental precursors of callous-unemotional behaviors in preschoolers,"Background: Early callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors identify children at risk for severe and persistent aggression and antisocial behavior. Recent work suggests that fearlessness and low social affiliation are implicated in the etiology of CU behaviors, although more research is needed to clarify these etiological pathways, as well as the role of parenting. Method: Using a sample of preschoolers (N = 620), we examined pathways between observed fear in response to social and non-social stimuli and observed social affiliation during social interactions at age 3 and increases child CU behaviors and oppositional-defiant behaviors from ages 3 to 5. To elucidate the role of parenting in exacerbating or buffering the relationships between low fear and social affiliation and CU behaviors, we tested whether parental harshness or low warmth moderated these pathways. Results: Fearlessness and low social affiliation uniquely predicted increases in CU behaviors, but not oppositional-defiant behaviors, from ages 3 to 5. Moreover, there was evidence for differential moderation of the fear pathway by harsh parenting, such that harsh parenting predicted increases in CU behaviors in fearless children but increases in oppositional-defiant behaviors in fearful children. Conclusions: Fearlessness and low social affiliation contribute to the development of CU behaviors. Harsh parenting can exacerbate the risky fearlessness pathway. Preventative interventions aimed at reducing risk for CU behaviors and persistent aggression and antisocial behavior should target socioaffiliative processes and provide parents with strategies and training to manage and scaffold rule-compliant behavior when children show low fearful arousal.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. 2 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA. 3 Department of Psychology, George Washington University, Washington, D.C., USA.","Rebecca Waller , Nicholas J Wagner , Megan Flom , Jody Ganiban , Kimberly J Saudino ",Psychol Med,2021 Apr,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Twin Study,Boston,Child Behavior / psychology*,Child, Preschool,Conduct Disorder / psychology*,Emotions,Empathy*,Fear / psychology*,Female,Humans,Interpersonal Relations*,Male,Parent-Child Relations*,Parenting / psychology,Parents / psychology,Social Behavior",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31875794
848,Pregnancy complications recur independently of maternal vascular malperfusion lesions,"Background: Spontaneous abortions, intrauterine growth restriction, and preeclampsia are thought to be caused by defective placentation and are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies. However, it is not known whether the recurrence of adverse outcomes is associated with the recurrence of placental pathology. We hypothesized that recurrent maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) underlies the recurrence of adverse outcomes. Methods: Using data from the National Collaborative Perinatal Project, we assessed the recurrence of pregnancy complications and MVM lesions (N = 3865), associations between a history of spontaneous abortions and MVM lesions or adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies (N = 8312), and whether the recurrence of pregnancy complications occurred independently of the presence of MVM lesions. Results: The odds of an MVM lesion were higher for a woman who had had an MVM lesion in a previous pregnancy (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.3-1.9), although this was marginally non-significant after adjusting for covariates such as gestational age, race and BMI. The odds of preeclampsia, a small-for-gestational-age infant, premature delivery and early pregnancy loss were 2.7-5.0 times higher if there had been that same adverse outcome in a previous pregnancy. A history of spontaneous abortions was associated with higher risk of a small-for-gestational-age baby (aOR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.7-3.4) and prematurity (aOR = 5.1; 95% CI 2.3-11.5 for extremely preterm), but not preeclampsia. The recurrence of adverse outcomes was significant when restricting analyses to women without MVM lesions. Similarly, associations between adverse outcomes and previous spontaneous abortions were significant when statistically controlling for the presence of MVM lesions, or excluding pregnancies with MVM lesions. Conclusions: Women with adverse outcomes in one pregnancy are at higher risk of complications in subsequent pregnancies. However, there is significant recurrence of adverse outcomes even in the absence of MVM.","Affiliations 1 Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada. 2 Centre for Cell Biology, Development and Disease, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada. 3 British Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada. 4 Women's Health Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada. 5 Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.","Julian K Christians , Maria F Huicochea Munoz ",PLoS One,2020 Feb 6,"Adult,Female,Humans,Placenta / pathology,Placental Circulation,Placentation / physiology*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / etiology,Pregnancy Complications / pathology,Pregnancy Outcome*,Recurrence,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32027702

Methods: Twenty-four children (aged 2-5 years) and their parents participated. Child sleep was assessed by accelerometer. Health of the family environment was quantified using the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Screening Tool (FNPA). Exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests and linear regression were used to determine associations between FNPA scores and child sleep. Results: Healthier Total FNPA, Physical Activity FNPA, and Sleep Routine scores were associated with earlier bedtime. Healthier Sleep Routine score was associated with more total minutes of sleep per night. Healthier screen time-related FNPA construct scores were associated with earlier bedtime. Conclusions: A composite score of family environment and behaviours, including physical activity- and nutrition-related constructs, was related to child sleep quality. Focus should be placed on the obesogenic family environment and healthy sleep routines to promote overall health among pre-school-aged populations.","Affiliations 1 Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. 2 Translational Biomedical Sciences Program, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, United States. 3 Division of Kinesiology and Health, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, United States. 4 Diabetes Institute, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio, United States. 5 Department of Primary Care, Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine, Athens, Ohio, United States.","Bethany D Williams , Jonathon Whipps , Susan B Sisson , Emily H Guseman ",J Paediatr Child Health,2021 Jul,"Body Mass Index,Child,Child, Preschool,Exercise*,Family,Humans,Nutritional Status*,Sleep",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33571379
850,Diet and Nutrition Advice After a Solid Tumor Diagnosis,"Purpose: Credible evidence-based diet and nutrition advice is essential for patients with cancer. This study aimed to explore what advice patients with cancer obtained before a formal dietetic visit. Methods: A multicenter, observational study was conducted in seven hospital-based oncology services. Consecutive patients were recruited at first dietetic assessment. In addition to routine dietetic assessment, participants completed a four-item questionnaire describing diet and nutrition advice obtained since diagnosis. Results: Seventy-seven patients participated. More than 80% had multiple nutrition-impact symptoms. In total, 53 (69%) obtained advice from professional and nonprofessional sources before dietetic visit. Family and friends were the most common sources of advice. More than one third got advice from (nondietetic) healthcare professionals. Most advice related to ""foods to include"" (61%) and ""foods to avoid"" (54%) in the diet. Many of the ""foods to avoid"" were important sources of micro- and macronutrients. Advice about dietary supplements (31%) and specific diets (28%) was common, rarely evidence-based, and frequently contradictory. Participants found it difficult to discern what advice was trustworthy and reliable. Despite this, most followed the advice. Conclusion: The majority of patients received diet and nutrition advice before first dietetic visit. Most of this came from nonprofessional sources. Any advice from nondietetic healthcare professionals was inconsistent or vague. This was mainly related to the avoidance and/or inclusion of particular foods and was often contradictory. Nevertheless, patients usually followed such advice fully. To help manage their frequent nutrition-impact symptoms and resolve the contradictory advice they had received, many expressed the need for earlier professional dietetic consultation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Health and Nutritional Sciences, IT Sligo, Sligo, Ireland. 2 Academic Department of Palliative Medicine, Our Lady's Hospice & Care Services, Dublin, Ireland. 3 School of Medicine, University of Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. 4 School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Science, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. 5 Dietetics Department, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. 6 Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. 7 Dietetics Department, St Vincent's Private Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. 8 Dietetics Department, University Hospital Limerick, Limerick, Ireland. 9 Dietetics Department, St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network, Dublin, Ireland. 10 Dietetics Department, Tallaght University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. 11 School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, University College Dublin, Ireland. 12 Department of Supportive Oncology, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, NC.","Amy Mullee , Aidan O'Donoghue , Pauline Uí Dhuibhir , Niamh O'Donoghue , Deirdre Burke , Veronica McSharry , Gillian Stewart , Louise Casey , Yvonne Donnelly , Julie Gallagher , Kiera Higgins , Fiona Roulston , Michelle Barrett , Clare A Corish , Declan Walsh ",JCO Oncol Pract,2021 Jul,"Multicenter Study,Observational Study,Diet,Dietary Supplements,Dietetics*,Humans,Neoplasms*,Nutritional Status",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33596097

852,Antidiabetic Potential of Naturally Occurring Sesquiterpenes: A Review,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is an endocrine disease, which is the 3rd leading cause of death in humans; additionally, it is one of the major key concerns over the globe. The high levels of glucose in the blood stream are as well characterized by hyperglycaemia leading to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, kidney, eyes, and nerves. The best treatment of DM is still not available; many scientists worldwide are trying hard to seek out suitable treatment of DM. Though numerous synthetic drugs are developed for the treatment of diabetes but their utility has been hampered because of several side effects and poor efficacy. Among various approaches for the treatment of DM, herbal medicine, enriched extracts, and naturally derived molecules are most effective. Plant based herbal medicines contain many bioactive phytochemicals, such as terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids & phenolics, etc. which are used in the treatment of many diseases. The plant-derived molecules and their suitable structure modification have given many leads or drugs to the world like sesquiterpene; artemisinin and their derivatives artemether & artesunate as an antimalarial drugs. Sesquiterpenes are available in the human diet and are largely taken as components of the many folk medicines and dietary supplements. Sesquiterpenes have a wide range of biological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic and antimicrobial, which make them potential targets for the development of new therapeutics and their usage for medical purposes. Natural products have gained the attention of the world due to their large number of biological activities, high safety and fewer side effect. The review mainly focuses on bioactive sesquiterpenes such as β-caryophyllene, dysidine, farnesol & eremanthin, etc., a class of terpenoids that may play an important role in the treatment or prevention of this gruesome disorder like diabetes, with their underlying mechanisms for the blood-glucose-lowering property.","Affiliation 1 Chemistry Section, Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine and Homoeopathy (PCIM&amp;H), Ministry of AYUSH, Ghaziabad (U.P.) 201002, India.","Anupam Maurya , Sweta Mohan , Subash C Verma ",Curr Top Med Chem,2021,"Review,Analgesics / pharmacology,Animals,Anti-Infective Agents / pharmacology,Anti-Inflammatory Agents / pharmacology,Antimalarials / pharmacology,Antineoplastic Agents / pharmacology,Artemisinins / pharmacology,Blood Glucose / drug effects,Diabetes Mellitus / drug therapy*,Drug Discovery,Herbal Medicine,Humans,Hypoglycemic Agents / chemistry*,Hypoglycemic Agents / pharmacology,Immunologic Factors / pharmacology,Phytochemicals / chemistry*,Phytochemicals / pharmacology,Phytotherapy,Plants, Medicinal,Sesquiterpenes / chemistry*,Sesquiterpenes / pharmacology,Analgesics,Anti-Infective Agents,Anti-Inflammatory Agents,Antimalarials,Antineoplastic Agents,Artemisinins,Blood Glucose,Hypoglycemic Agents,Immunologic Factors,Phytochemicals,Sesquiterpenes,artemisinin",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33676391
853,Current Prevention of COVID-19: Natural Products and Herbal Medicine,"Starting from December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused tremendous economic loss and unprecedented health crisis across the globe. While the development of cure is at full speed, less attention and fewer effort have been spent on the prevention of this rapidly spreading respiratory infectious disease. Although so far, several vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical trials, limited data have been released regarding the vaccine efficacy and safety in human, not mention the long-term effectiveness of those vaccines remain as open question yet. Natural products and herbal medicines have been historically used for acute respiratory infection and generally show acceptable toxicity. The favorable stability for oral formulation and ease of scaling up manufacture make it ideal candidate for prophylactic. Hereby, we summarized the most recent advance in SARS-CoV-2 prevention including vaccine development as well as experimental prophylactics. Mainly, we reviewed the natural products showing inhibitory effect on human coronavirus, and discussed the herbal medicines lately used for COVID-19, especially focused on the herbal products already approved by regulatory agency with identifiable patent number. We demonstrated that to fill in the response gap between appropriate treatment and commercially available vaccine, repurposing natural products and herbal medicines as prophylactic will be a vigorous approach to stop or at least slow down SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the interest of public health, this will lend health officials better control on the current pandemic.","Affiliations 1 Formula-pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. 2 Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States. 3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States. 4 School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.","Junqing Huang , Gabriel Tao , Jingwen Liu , Junming Cai , Zhongyu Huang , Jia-Xu Chen ",Front Pharmacol,2020 Oct 16,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33178026

The contribution of phytochemicals, vegetable oils and of lipid matrices has been highlighted by comparative study of size, stability, entrapment efficiency, morphological characteristics, and thermal behavior. According to the in vitro MTS and RTCA results, the dual herbal-NLCs were no cytotoxic toward endothelial cells at concentrations between 25 and 100 µg/mL. A rapid release of Glycyrrhiza glabra and a motivated delay of Diosgenin was detected by the in vitro release experiments. Dual herbal-NLCs showed an elevated ability to annihilate long-life cationic radicals (ABTS•+) and short-life oxygenated radicals (an inhibition of 63.4% ABTS•+, while the ability to capture radical oxygen species reached 96%). The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly inhibited by the newly herbals-NLC (up to 97.9% inhibition of TNF-α and 62.5% for IL-6). The study may open a new pharmacotherapy horizon; it provides a comprehensive basis for the use of herbal-NLC in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Applied Chemistry and Materials Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Polizu No 1, 011061 Bucharest, Romania. 2 Virology Institute Stefan S.

855,Trajectories of Parent Participation in Early Intervention/Prevention Services: The Case for Flexible Paraprofessional-led Services,"Objective: This study examined parents' participation in a school-and home-based prevention and early intervention service model designed to promote positive parenting and parent involvement in schooling. Method: Paraprofessionals (n = 32) employed by four social service agencies provided parenting support and education through parent groups, home/community visits, case management, and individual contacts to African American and Latino/a families in urban high-poverty communities (n = 375). In this open trial, we identified longitudinal trajectories of parents' participation across all service formats over the course of a full school year using latent class growth models, then examined group differences in baseline child and family characteristics, participation in specific service formats, and parenting skills practice across the year. Results: Four distinct trajectories were identified: parents with consistently low participation; parents whose participation declined and subsequently rebounded; parents with increasing participation; and parents with consistently high participation. Significant differences between trajectory groups were identified on baseline child and family characteristics, and the number and types of service formats in which parents participated participation. Parents across trajectories consistently practiced parenting skills over the school year, with parents who demonstrated increasing participation over time showing the most growth in the number of skills practiced each month. Conclusions: Unique patterns of parent participation across a school year in paraprofessional-delivered services indicates the promise of capitalizing on multiple opportunities to engage parents and suggests the potential for paraprofessional staff to overcome longstanding disparities in parent involvement in children's mental health services.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina. 2 Educational Psychology, University of Illinois at Chicago. 3 Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago.","Davielle Lakind , Grace Cua , Tara G Mehta , Dana Rusch , Marc S Atkins ",J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol,2021 Mar-Apr,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Blacks / psychology,Blacks / statistics & numerical data,Child,Child Rearing* / psychology,Early Intervention, Educational*,Female,Hispanic or Latino / psychology,Hispanic or Latino / statistics & numerical data,Humans,Male,Mental Health Services*,Parenting* / psychology,Parents / education*,Parents / psychology*,Poverty,Schools*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31860358
856,Herbal medicine treatment for patients with chronic subdural hematoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background and purpose: In Asian countries, herbal medicines have been used to treat Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) as an adjunctive therapy. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine on treating CSDH and preventing recurrent CSDH. Methods: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, CiNii, KTKP, NDSL, OASIS, and CNKI for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of herbal medicines on CSDH. Results: Seven studies (n = 646) were included. The overall methodological quality of these studies was low. In the herbal group, the meta-analysis indicated statistically significant improvements in the total effective rate and recurrence rate as compared with those in the non-herbal group. Herbal treatments were found to be relatively safe. Conclusion: Herbal medicines might be efficacious in the management of CSDH and prevent its recurrence. Further rigorous studies will have to be conducted in order to make more definite conclusions.","Affiliations 1 Department of Cardiology and Neurology, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

858,Coparenting and parenting outcomes of online relationship interventions for low-income couples,"Web-based relationship programs are effective in improving low-income couples' relationship functioning. However, little is known about: (a) whether parenting couples presenting for relationship help also have difficulties in coparenting and parenting, (b) whether relationship-focused programs can improve these two domains, and (c) whether program effects differ across baseline levels of those domains. We examined these questions in a parenting subsample (Nindividuals = 934) and a coparenting subsample (Ndyads = 342) of low-income couples participating in a randomized controlled trial of two web-based relationship education programs-the OurRelationship (OR) program and the ePREP program. Although the majority of participants were relationally distressed at baseline, most coparents (83%) reported parenting well together. Parents ""often"" engaged in nurturing behaviors and ""hardly ever"" or ""sometimes"" felt overwhelmed by their parenting responsibilities. Among parents who had engaged in the harsh verbal discipline (59%) and physical discipline (28%) in the past month, the average frequency was 4.08 and 5.50 times per month, respectively. Moreover, compared to waitlist control parents, parents in OR but not ePREP reported significantly greater improvements in parental nurturance and harsh verbal discipline during the program. There was no evidence of program effects on coparenting, physical discipline, or parenting stress for OR or ePREP, nor was there any evidence of baseline functioning moderating program effects. Findings suggested that most low-income parents seeking relationship help did not have severe problems in coparenting or parenting and that effective relationship programs without a focus on coparenting and/or parenting had somewhat limited effects on these domains.

859,Parent-adolescent relationship quality as a predictor of leaving home,"Introduction: Leaving home is a significant life transition that effects both emerging adults and their families. The age of leaving home has been increasing across industrialized societies, and children remain dependent on their parents for a longer time. The present study investigated the association between parent-adolescent relationships and timing of leaving home over a timespan of six years: From middle adolescence to emerging adulthood. Methods: Data came from three cohorts of two longitudinal studies in the Netherlands (N = 1100). At the start of the study, participants had a mean age of 16.41 (SD=.71), and approximately half of them (n = 547) were male. Adolescents completed questionnaires on parent-adolescent relationship quality. The impact of positive and negative relationship characteristics on timing of leaving home were examined separately for mothers and fathers. Results: Survival analysis results showed that higher levels of mother's and father's warmth, and higher levels of power attributed to father, but not mother, predicted later timing of leaving home. Higher levels of parental autonomy support predicted earlier timing of leaving home. Conflict with parents was not associated with timing of leaving home, except in the father-daughter relationship. Only, the effect of parental warmth on timing of leaving home remained robust when controlling for age, gender, education level, and SES. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that certain parent-adolescent relationship characteristics contribute to the increase in age of leaving home. Parents may be able to prepare their children for a self-sufficient living by balancing warmth and autonomy support they provide during adolescence.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Social and Behavioral Studies, Utrecht University, Heidelberglaan 1, 80125, 3508, TC Utrecht, the Netherlands.

860,Uncovering the Anticancer Mechanisms of Chinese Herbal Medicine Formulas: Therapeutic Alternatives for Liver Cancer,"The potential values of Chinese herbal formulas in treating various diseases are well known. In addition to more than 2,000 years of history, herbal medicine is appreciated for its remarkable efficacy in a lot of cases, which warrants a role in public health care worldwide, especially in East Asian countries. Liver cancer is the second most fatal cancer across the world. Recent studies have extensively investigated the chemical profiles and pharmacological effects of Chinese herbal medicine formulas on liver cancer. Either through observational follow-up or experimental studies, multiple herbal formulas have benefits implicated in the management of liver cancer. However, complex composition of each formula imposes restrictions on promoting clinical practice and global recognition. Therefore, understanding the mode of action of Chinese herbal medicine formulas in depth may offer sufficient evidence for their clinical use. This review highlighted the chemical characteristics and molecular mechanisms of actions of prominent Chinese herbal medicine formulas and summarized the correlated findings on the potential use in liver cancer treatment. At last, the present progresses of Chinese herbal medicine formulas in the perspective of clinical trials are discussed.","Affiliation 1 School of Chinese Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.","Feiyu Chen , Zhangfeng Zhong , Hor Yue Tan , Wei Guo , Cheng Zhang , Chi-Wing Tan , Sha Li , Ning Wang , Yibin Feng ",Front Pharmacol,2020 Mar 18,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32256363
861,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Herbal Therapy: Pertinent Issues Relating to Toxicity and Standardization of Phytopharmaceuticals,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a virulent viral disease that has now become a public health emergency of global significance and still without an approved treatment regimen or cure. In the absence of curative drugs and with vaccines development still in progress, alternative approaches to stem the tide of the pandemic are being considered. The potential of a phytotherapeutic approach in the management of the dreaded disease has gained attention, especially in developing countries, with several claims of the development of anti-COVID-19 herbal formulations. This is a plausible approach especially with the increasing acceptance of herbal medicine in both alternative and orthodox medical practices worldwide. Also, the established efficacy of herbal remedies in the treatment of numerous viral diseases including those caused by coronaviruses, as well as diseases with symptoms associated with COVID-19, presents a valid case for serious consideration of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. However, there are legitimate concerns and daunting challenges with the use of herbs and herbal products. These include issues of quality control, unethical production practice, inadequate information on the composition, use and mechanisms, weak regulatory policies, herb-drug interactions and adverse reactions, and the tendency for abuse. This review discusses the feasibility of intervention with herbal medicine in the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to take proactive measures to protect public health by improving the quality and safety of herbal medicine deployed to combat the disease.

862,Do online parenting programs create change?: A meta-analysis,"With online education and programs becoming increasingly common, it is necessary to examine their effectiveness. In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis of online parenting programs. In this meta-analysis, we included 28 studies yielding 127 effect sizes examining 15 outcome variables. We found that online parenting programs had the strongest effects on increasing positive parenting and parents' encouragement. We also found significant effects of reducing negative parent-child interactions, child problem behaviors, negative discipline strategies, parenting conflicts, parent stress, child anxiety, parent anger, and parent depression. Results also revealed programs' significant effects on increasing parent confidence, positive child behavior and parenting satisfaction. Comparisons of programs that included clinical support (meaning programs through which participants had access to content experts, therapists, or content specialists in conjunction with the online program) versus programs that only contained online components, revealed no significant differences in 6 program outcomes between programs with and without clinical support. Comparisons of programs provided to targeted populations versus general populations revealed no significant differences in four program outcomes between populations. Results suggest that online parenting programs can provide benefits for parents who may not be able to access in-person resources.

Study design: Retrospective cohort study of twin pregnancies prior to 14 weeks at a single institution from 2005 to 2019, all of whom had a first trimester ultrasound. We excluded monoamniotic twins, fetal anomalies, history of fetal reduction or spontaneous reduction, and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Ultrasound data were reviewed, and we compared pregnancy outcomes after 24 weeks in women with and without a SCH at their initial ultrasound 60/7 to 136/7 weeks. Regression analysis was used to control for any differences in baseline characteristics. Results: A total of 760 women with twin pregnancies met inclusion criteria for the study, 68 (8.9%) of whom had a SCH. Women with SCH were more likely to have vaginal bleeding and had their initial ultrasound at earlier gestational ages. On univariate analysis, SCH was not significantly associated with gestational age at delivery, preterm birth, birthweight of either twin, low birthweight percentiles of either twin, fetal demise, or preeclampsia. SCH was associated with placental abruption on univariate analysis, but not after controlling for vaginal bleeding and gestational age at the time of the initial ultrasound (adjusted odds ratio: 2.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.63-6.42). Among women with SCH, SCH size was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: In women with twin pregnancies, the finding of a first trimester SCH is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes >24 weeks.","Affiliations 1 Maternal Fetal Medicine Associates, PLLC, New York, New York. 2 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York. 3 Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, Harlem, New York, New York. 4 Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, District of Columbia.","Mariam Naqvi , Mackenzie N Naert , Hanaa Khadraoui , Alberto M Rodriguez , Amalia G Namath , Munira Ali , Nathan S Fox ",Am J Perinatol,2021 Jul,"Adult,Female,Gestational Age,Hematoma / complications*,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications*,Pregnancy Outcome*,Pregnancy Trimester, First,Pregnancy, Twin*,Retrospective Studies,Twins,Ultrasonography, Prenatal,Uterine Hemorrhage / complications",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31887747
865,The influence of nutrition on clinical outcomes in children with cancer,"Adequate and appropriate nutrition is essential for growth and development in children; all put at risk in those with cancer. Overnutrition and undernutrition at diagnosis raise the risk of increased morbidity and mortality during therapy and beyond. All treatment modalities can jeopardize nutritional status with potentially adverse effects on clinical outcomes. Accurate assessment of nutritional status and nutrient balance is essential, with remedial interventions delivered promptly when required. Children with cancer in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are especially disadvantaged with concomitant challenges in the provision of nutritional support. Cost-effective advances in the form of ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) may offer solutions. Studies in LMICs have defined a critical role for the gut microbiome in the causation of undernutrition in children and have demonstrated a beneficial effect of selected RUTF in redressing the imbalanced microbiota and improving nutritional status. Challenges in high-income countries relate both to concerns about the potential disadvantage of preexisting obesity in those newly diagnosed and to undernutrition identified at diagnosis and during treatment. Much remains to be understood but the prospects are bright for offsetting malnutrition in children with cancer, resulting in enhanced opportunity for healthy survival.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. 2 Translational Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom. 3 NIHR Cancer and Nutrition Collaboration, Southampton, United Kingdom.","Ronald D Barr , Michael C G Stevens ",Pediatr Blood Cancer,2020 Jun,"Review,Age Factors,Child,Child Nutrition Disorders / diet therapy*,Child Nutrition Disorders / metabolism*,Child Nutrition Disorders / mortality,Child Nutrition Disorders / pathology,Humans,Neoplasms / diet therapy*,Neoplasms / metabolism*,Neoplasms / mortality,Neoplasms / pathology,Nutritional Status*,Nutritional Support,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32134218

Recommendations for nutritional support in critical illness are needed. Methods: The ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition (ESPGHAN-CoN) conducted a systematic literature search on nutritional support in critically ill neonates, including studies on basic metabolism. The Medline database and the Cochrane Library were used in the search for relevant publications. The quality of evidence was reviewed and discussed before voting on recommendations, and a consensus of 90% or more was required for the final approval. Important research gaps were also identified. Results: This position paper provides clinical recommendations on nutritional support during different phases of critical illness in preterm and term neonates based on available literature and expert opinion. Conclusion: Basic research along with adequately powered trials are urgently needed to resolve key uncertainties on metabolism and nutrient requirements in this heterogeneous patient population.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neonatal Intensive Care, Oslo University Hospital, Norway. 2 Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic. 3 Newcastle Neonatal Service, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust and Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 4 Human Nutrition, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing, University of Glasgow, New Lister Building, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK. 5 Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Foggia, Italy. 6 Department of paediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. 7 Paediatric Gastroenterology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. 8 Paris University, APHP Necker-Enfants Malades hospital, Paris, France and CNRC, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. 9 Paediatreic Hepatology Gastroenterology and Transplantation, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIIII, Bergamo, Italy. 10 Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan; Department of Paediatrics, Ospedale dei Bambini Vittore Buzzi Milan, Italy. 11 Department of Clinical Sciences, Paediatrics, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.","Sissel Jennifer Moltu , Jiri Bronsky , Nicholas Embleton , Konstantinos Gerasimidis , Flavia Indrio , Jutta Köglmeier , Barbara de Koning , Alexandre Lapillonne , Lorenzo Norsa , Elvira Verduci , Magnus Domellöf , ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,2021 Aug 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Critical Illness* / therapy,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Infant, Premature*,Nutritional Status,Nutritional Support,Parenteral Nutrition",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33605663
868,Are Parent- and Teacher-Reported Executive Function Difficulties Associated With Parenting Stress for Children Diagnosed With ADHD?,"Objective: To examine the relationship between parenting stress and parent- and teacher-reported executive function difficulties (EFDs) for childhood ADHD. Method: A secondary analysis using linear regression was conducted on parent- and teacher-completed Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and Parenting Stress Indexes for 5- to 12-year-olds (n = 243) with ADHD. Results: The linear combination of teacher- and parent-reported EFDs accounted for 49% of the variance in child-related parenting stress. Teacher-reported school-based EFDs were relatively inconsequential, having accounted for only 3% of this variance. This stress is best explained by EFDs with emotional control in the school environment and parent-reported EFDs with emotional control, inhibit, monitor, and shift. Conclusion: Parent-reported EFDs, and less so school-based EFDs, are related to parenting stress, but only in regard to EFDs likely underpinning behavioral outbursts and those likely underpinning the daily hassles of providing specialized care to children with ADHD.","Affiliations 1 University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 2 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Falls Church, USA. 3 University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada. 4 Scarborough Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 5 Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.","Alan McLuckie , Ashley L Landers , Melissa Rowbotham , Jeff Landine , Michael Schwartz , David Ng ",J Atten Disord,2021 Jan,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*,Child,Child, Preschool,Emotions,Executive Function,Humans,Parenting*,Parents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29482475

870,Understanding the meaning of autonomy in adolescent pregnancy decision-making: lessons from Ghana,"Introduction: adolescent pregnancy in Ghana, like in most low and middle income countries, is an issue of immense public health importance. Pregnant adolescents are faced with the stronger dilemma of either terminating the unwanted pregnancy or keeping it. This discourse which is based on findings from empirical research in Accra Ghana aims at contributing to the usefulness of understanding the meaning and scope of autonomy when it comes to providing ethically grounded, and adolescent friendly, reproductive health care services to pregnant adolescents. The aim of this work was to document the meaning and determinants of autonomous decision making among pregnant adolescents in the James Town area of Accra, Ghana. Methods: thirty (30) semi-structured in depth interviews were conducted among adolescents who had been pregnant at least once, 23 in depth interviews among purposively selected stakeholders (parents, teachers, NGO staff working in reproductive health, community volunteers), and 8 focus group discussions among parents, teachers, adolescent students who had not been pregnant before, and adolescents who had at least one pregnancy in the past. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Results: most adolescents reported that the final decision to continue a pregnancy to term or go in for an abortion was taken by them. The partner´s willingness to take responsibility of the pregnant adolescent and baby, as well as financial considerations, were main players in deciding upon the pregnancy outcomes. Cultural desirability for children and health care provider/father paternalism (power dynamics) in the decision-making process were central considerations in the decision-making process. Unaffordable and unfriendly safe abortion services pushed adolescents to either continue pregnancies to term against their will, or opt to visit unsafe abortion care providers. Conclusion: adolescents stand to make truly autonomous decisions if they are provided with the right information, at the right time, at the right place, by the right persons, and in the right way. Health system, economic, and cultural factors play significant roles in rendering pregnant adolescent autonomy meaningful when deciding upon their pregnancy outcomes. Continuing pregnancies to term against one´s will or being forced to go in for an abortion are ethically unjustified. Further research is required to examine the long-term consequences of forced pregnancy terminations or births.","Affiliations 1 Lincoln International Institute for Rural Health (LIIRH), University of Lincoln, Lincoln, United Kingdom. 2 Global South Health Services and Research, GSHS, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",Luchuo Engelbert Bain ,Pan Afr Med J,2021 Sep 13,"Abortion, Induced / psychology,Adolescent,Decision Making*,Female,Focus Groups,Ghana,Humans,Interviews as Topic,Paternalism,Personal Autonomy*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy in Adolescence / psychology*,Pregnancy, Unwanted / psychology,Pregnant Women / psychology*,Reproductive Health Services / organization & administration",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34795815
871,Brain mechanisms of insomnia: new perspectives on causes and consequences,"While insomnia is the second most common mental disorder, progress in our understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited. The present review addresses the definition and prevalence of insomnia and explores its subjective and objective characteristics across the 24-hour day. Subsequently, the review extensively addresses how the vulnerability to develop insomnia is affected by genetic variants, early life stress, major life events, and brain structure and function. Further supported by the clear mental health risks conveyed by insomnia, the integrated findings suggest that the vulnerability to develop insomnia could rather be found in brain circuits regulating emotion and arousal than in circuits involved in circadian and homeostatic sleep regulation. Finally, a testable model is presented. The model proposes that in people with a vulnerability to develop insomnia, the locus coeruleus is more sensitive to-or receives more input from-the salience network and related circuits, even during rapid eye movement sleep, when it should normally be sound asleep. This vulnerability may ignite a downward spiral of insufficient overnight adaptation to distress, resulting in accumulating hyperarousal, which, in turn, impedes restful sleep and moreover increases the risk of other mental health adversity. Sensitized brain circuits are likely to be subjectively experienced as ""sleeping with one eye open"".

873,Effect of Daikenchuto On Spontaneous Intestinal Tumors in Apc Min/+ Mice,"Daikenchuto (TU-100) is herbal medicine which predominantly contains ginger, Japanese pepper, and ginseng. We investigated whether TU-100 can affect the composition of gut flora and intestinal tumor development using ApcMin/+ mice, a murine model of intestinal tumor. Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and short-chain fatty acid analysis were performed on faecal samples. Tumor number and size were analysed. Any change in gene expression of the tumor tissues was assessed by real-time PCR. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that the faecal microbiota cluster of TU-100-fed mice was different from the microbiota of control mice. However, no significant difference was observed in the concentration of short-chain fatty acids, tumor number, and gene expression levels between the two groups. Our data showed that TU-100 can affect the intestinal environment; however, it does not contribute in tumor progression or inhibition in our setting.","Affiliations 1 Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan. 2 TechnoSuruga Laboratory Co., Ltd, Shizuoka, Japan. 3 Division of Gastroenterology, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, People's Republic of China.","Lingling Kong , Namiko Hoshi , Daisuke Watanabe , Yasutaka Yamada , Eiichiro Yasutomi , Soichiro Adachi , Makoto Ooi , Yunlong Sui , Ryutaro Yoshida , Ryohei Sekimoto , Eri Tokunaga , Haruka Miyazaki , Yuna Ku , Haruka Takenaka , Tadao Kunihiro , Jun Inoue , Zibin Tian , Yuzo Kodama ",Kobe J Med Sci,2021 Jan 4,"Animals,Feces,Gastrointestinal Microbiome / drug effects*,Gastrointestinal Microbiome / genetics,Herbal Medicine*,Intestinal Mucosa / drug effects*,Intestinal Neoplasms / drug therapy*,Intestinal Neoplasms / pathology,Mice,Microbiota,Panax,Plant Extracts / pharmacology*,RNA, Ribosomal, 16S,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Zanthoxylum,Zingiberaceae,Plant Extracts,RNA, Ribosomal, 16S,dai-kenchu-to",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33994517
874,Does nutrition for cancer patients feed the tumour? A clinical perspective,"This review aims to answer to two basic questions: a) Which substrates does a tumour utilize and is there a regimen that might potentially favour the host over the tumour? and b) Does nutritional intervention disproportionally affect tumour growth? Literature to date focuses on humans; although some references to molecular mechanisms regulating cancer cells metabolism derive from studies on experimental tumours and cell biology. Literature shows that some tumours, especially those of the brain and head/neck and lung, are glucose-dependent, and patients with these tumours could benefit from a normocaloric ketogenic diet provided these tumours exhibit high fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) captation. A high fat-protein, low carbohydrate diet appears to better fulfil the nutritional requirements of the cancer patient. Current evidence shows no improvement in tumoral response after restricting patients' caloric intake; whereas malnutrition is acknowledged as an important negative predictive and prognostic factor in all cancer patients.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.

875,Relationships between REM and NREM in the NREM-REM sleep cycle: a review on competing concepts,"Sixty-five years after the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the reasons why we sleep and why we need two states of sleep are still largely unclear. Moreover, the functional relationship between the two types of sleep remains the matter of much conjecture. Several questions come to mind. How does sleep regulation in monophasic and polyphasic animals compare? What are the circadian and homeostatic influences on both states? Are non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM states dependent on each other, or are they regulated independently? What about long-term and short-term regulation? In addition, what determines the number and duration of cycles per night? What roles are played by temperature and energy allocation? The evidence collected over the years regarding these questions is summarized here, trying to address each issue.","Affiliation 1 Department of Psychiatry & Laboratory of Psychiatric Research (ULB 266), Cliniques universitaires de Bruxelles, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Bruxelles, Belgium.

876,Physical and Social Environment Relationship With Sleep Health and Disorders,"Sleep health is a multidimensional construct that includes adequate duration, quality, and appropriately timed sleep that may be influenced by environmental factors. In this review, we focus on how an individual's living and sleeping environment, both the surrounding neighborhood physical and social features and the atmosphere around them, may impact their sleep health. We explore the associations of the physical environment (urban density, recreational facilities, green space, mixed land use, and healthy food stores), neighborhood deprivation (disadvantage and disorder), and the social environment (social cohesion, safety, and stigma) with sleep in both adult and pediatric populations. We investigate how physical and social environmental features may lead to alterations in the timing, duration, and quality of sleep and contribute to the most prevalent sleep disorders: insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian rhythm disorders. We also review how ambient factors such as artificial light, environmental noise, and air pollution may contribute to sleep pathology. We have included key studies and recent emerging data regarding how the differential distribution of environmental factors that may affect sleep health may contribute to sleep health disparities.","Affiliations 1 Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

877,Application of health behaviour theory to sleep health improvement,"Although sleep hygiene is often used for broad sleep health promotion efforts, sleep hygiene education programmes are largely ineffective. These programmes are limited by their lack of a theoretical foundation. Health behaviour theory (HBT) has been used for decades to successfully predict and modify many health behaviours, but its use in the study of sleep health is rare. The purpose of this review is threefold. First, four dominant HBTs will be introduced. Second, the brief literature on HBT and sleep health will be reviewed. Lastly, a translational research agenda will be proposed. The present review concludes that HBT shows potential in both the prediction and modification of sleep health, and that there are several short- and long- term research goals to advance these efforts.","Affiliations 1 North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota. 2 Sanford Center for Biobehavioral Research, Fargo, North Dakota.","Michael P Mead , Leah A Irish ",J Sleep Res,2020 Oct,"Review,Health Behavior / physiology*,Health Promotion / methods*,Humans,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Hygiene / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31758596
878,Herbal medicine for the management of COVID-19 during the medical observation period: A review of guidelines,Background: Medical observation period is a period of 14 days after any exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred. This review aimed to summarize and analyze the herbs and herbal formulae recommended by available guidelines. Methods: A total of 14 sources were searched for potential guidelines that provide herbal medicine treatment for the medical observation period of COVID-19. We summarized and analyzed the recommended herbal formulae and performed a network analysis to identify the relationship between herbs. Results: We found 9 guidelines that provide herbal formula for medical observation based on clinical manifestation. There are 12 herbal formulae with a total of 53 herbs recommended by the guidelines. The result of our network analysis showed that the herb Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (Chen Pi) strongly paired with the herb Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (Gan Cao).

879,Herbal Nanoformulations for Asthma Treatment,"Background: In recent decades, the prevalence of asthma has substantially increased worldwide. Advances in phytochemistry and phytopharmacology have clarified the active ingredients and biological activities of medicinal plant products for treating asthma, and the role of herbal therapies in asthma treatment has become increasingly evident. However, most plant extracts have low solubility and poor stability of bioactive components, resulting in low bioavailability and loss of efficacy. Owing to these shortcomings, the clinical use of many herbal extracts is limited. Objective: To summarise and analyse the characteristics of herbal nanoformulations and their application in asthma treatment. The objective of this review article is to address the emerging trends of herbal nanoformulations for an effective treatment of asthma. Methods: Various research and review articles from reputed international journals were referred to and compiled. Results: The nano-sized herbal formulations improve the solubility and bioavailability of herbal medicines and contribute to the sustained release of drugs, thus, increasing the therapeutic applications of herbal extracts. The review present different types of herbal nanoformulations, including micelles, nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles and nanoemulsions, which are potential nanodrugs for asthma treatment. Conclusions: Herbal nanoformulations have shown great prospects for the treatment of asthma in recent years. More safety and toxicity data are still needed to promote their development and application.","Affiliation 1 School of Basic Medical, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming Yunnan, P.R.

880,Childhood correlates of adult positive mental well-being in three British longitudinal studies,"Background: Previous evidence has shown how experiences within childhood, such as parenting and socioeconomic conditions, are associated later on in life with adult mental well-being. However, these studies tend to focus on childhood experiences in isolation, and fewer studies have investigated how multiple aspects of the childhood environment, including both socioeconomic and psychosocial aspects, are associated with adult positive mental well-being. Using data from three British birth cohort studies, we investigated how prospective measures of the childhood environment up to the age of 16 years were associated with midlife adult mental well-being and whether similar associations were replicated across different generations. Methods: Childhood environment comprised socioeconomic circumstances, psychosocial factors (child-rearing and parenting, family instability) and parental health. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, a validated instrument measuring both hedonic and eudaemonic aspects of well-being, was administered in mid-life. We modelled associations between childhood environment domains and well-being. Results: Despite changes in social context in all three studies, poorer quality parent-child relationships and poor parental mental health were strongly and independently associated with poorer adult mental well-being. Socioeconomic circumstances were also associated with adult mental well-being, but the association was weaker than for the measures of parenting or parental mental health. Conclusion: These findings confirm that parenting and parental mental health, as well as socioeconomic circumstances, are important for adult mental well-being. Interventions in early childhood aimed at reducing socioeconomic adversity and offering support to parents might be warranted, to enhance adult mental well-being later on in the life course.","Affiliations 1 Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK natasha.wood@ndph.ox.ac.uk. 2 CLOSER, UCL, London, UK. 3 Centre for Longitudinal Studies, UCL, London, UK. 4 Psychology, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. 5 The Health Foundation, London, UK.","Natasha Wood , Rebecca Hardy , David Bann , Catharine Gale , Mai Stafford ",J Epidemiol Community Health,2021 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Child,Child, Preschool,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Mental Health* / statistics & numerical data,Parenting* / psychology,Parents* / psychology,Prospective Studies,Socioeconomic Factors,United Kingdom",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32967893
881,Mechanistic aspects of carotenoid health benefits - where are we now?,"Dietary intake and tissue levels of carotenoids have been associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity, brain-related diseases and some types of cancer. However, intervention trials with isolated carotenoid supplements have mostly failed to confirm the postulated health benefits. It has thereby been speculated that dosing, matrix and synergistic effects, as well as underlying health and the individual nutritional status plus genetic background do play a role. It appears that our knowledge on carotenoid-mediated health benefits may still be incomplete, as the underlying mechanisms of action are poorly understood in relation to human relevance. Antioxidant mechanisms - direct or via transcription factors such as NRF2 and NF-κB - and activation of nuclear hormone receptor pathways such as of RAR, RXR or also PPARs, via carotenoid metabolites, are the basic principles which we try to connect with carotenoid-transmitted health benefits as exemplified with described common diseases including obesity/diabetes and cancer. Depending on the targeted diseases, single or multiple mechanisms of actions may play a role. In this review and position paper, we try to highlight our present knowledge on carotenoid metabolism and mechanisms translatable into health benefits related to several chronic diseases.","Affiliations 1 Luxembourg Institute of Health, Population Health Department, Nutrition and Health Research Group, 1 A-B, rue Thomas Edison, L-1445 Strassen, Luxembourg. 2 Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Nutrition and Biotechnology, Universitat de les Illes Balears and CIBER fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición, Cra.

883,Nutrition risk prevalence and nutrition care recommendations for hospitalized and critically-ill patients with COVID-19,"Nutritional status is an often-overlooked component in infectious disease severity. Hospitalized or critically ill patients are at higher risk of malnutrition, and rapid assessment and treatment of poor nutritional status can impact clinical outcomes. As it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 5% of these patients require admission to an ICU. Per clinical practice guidelines, nutrition therapy should be a core component of treatment regimens. On account of the urgent need for information relating to the nutritional support of these patients, clinical practice guidance was published based on current critical care guidelines. However, a growing body of literature is now available that may provide further direction for the nutritional status and support in COVID-19 patients. This review, intended for the health care community, provides a heretofore lacking in-depth discussion and summary of the current data on nutrition risk and assessment and clinical practice guidelines for medical nutrition therapy for hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Affiliations 1 Scientific and Medical Affairs, Abbott Nutrition, 2900 Easton Square Place, Columbus, OH, 43219, USA.

884,Religiosity and spirituality among Filipino mothers and fathers: Relations to psychological well-being and parenting,"Religion is recognized as an influential social institution in the Philippines, yet religiosity and spirituality are rarely studied in the context of Filipino family and parent-child relationships. We examine the direct associations of religiosity and spirituality with the psychological well-being and parenting behaviors of 115 mothers and 83 fathers residing in urban neighborhoods in the Philippines. Participants completed orally administered questionnaires on engagement in religious activities, spiritual beliefs, hope, psychological distress, warmth, and harsh parenting. Analyses using structural equation modeling showed that engagement in religious activities was significantly associated with the higher levels of hope and less frequent harsh parenting. In addition, parental warmth had a stronger positive association with spiritual beliefs than with engagement in religious activities. Neither religious activity engagement nor spiritual beliefs were significantly associated with psychological distress. We discuss shared and distinct aspects of religiosity and spirituality that may explain their associations with positive parenting outcomes, and highlight the potential benefits of spiritual beliefs and experiences within the Filipino family context.

885,The influence of nutrigenetics on biomarkers of selenium nutritional status,"Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for human biology that executes its functions as the amino acid selenocysteine via selenoproteins, which have important functions in, for example, antioxidation, immunomodulation, thyroid metabolism, and human fertility. Se nutritional status is assessed using the quantification of blood Se biomarkers, which are influenced by several factors, including diet, age, gender, smoking status, alcohol consumption, health condition, and the genetic characteristics of individuals. Nutrigenetic studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in selenoproteins that might clarify the high variability in values reported for biomarkers of Se nutritional status in different populations, and the response of these biomarkers to Se supplementation with either organic or inorganic forms of Se. This review aims to (1) define the basic aspects of Se biology, (2) describe the current most commonly used biomarkers of Se nutritional status, and (3) provide a summary of associations between functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in selenoproteins and biomarkers of Se status in healthy populations.","Affiliations 1 Department of Food and Experimental Nutrition, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. 2 Food Research Center (FoRC), CEPID-FAPESP Research Innovation and Dissemination Centers, São Paulo Research Foundation, São Paulo, Brazil. 3 C2VN, INRAE, INSERM, Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France. 4 Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.","Janaina L S Donadio , Graziela B S Duarte , Patrick Borel , Silvia M F Cozzolino , Marcelo M Rogero ",Nutr Rev,2021 Oct 11,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Biomarkers,Humans,Nutrigenomics,Nutritional Status,Selenium*,Selenoproteins / genetics,Biomarkers,Selenoproteins,Selenium",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33570152
886,Overall control herbal medicine in best consistency,"The standard preparation (SP) based on the quantitative fingerprint was proposed to control the quality of compound licorice tablets (CPLTs) in this paper, which is a great way to control the quality consistency nowadays. Here, taking China 145 batches of CPLTs from 9 manufacturers as samples to set up High Performance Liquid Chromatography fingerprints and CPLT-SP, and employing the systematically quantified fingerprint method (SQFM) combined five markers' contents to evaluate their quality. The results showed that all samples were qualified. The quantitative analysis of multi-components by single-marker (QAMS) for the determination of five components in CPLTs was applied, and there was no striking diversity in the results compared to the standard curve method. Furthermore, the correlation between raw materials and preparation of CPLTs was studied for predicting quality intelligently. As well as the ultraviolet full fingerprint dissolution was applied to evaluate the rationality of preparation. The results demonstrated that SQFM based on SP can integrally and perfectly control the quality of HD in best consistency.","Affiliations 1 College of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 110016, China. 2 College of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 110016, China.

887,Acupuncture and herbal medicine for female infertility: an overview of systematic reviews,"Background: Acupuncture and herbal medicine have been used as additional treatments for infertility or as an adjuvant treatment of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in infertility. Many systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MA) have been published. This paper reviews the SRs and MA of acupuncture and herbal medicine on infertility to provide evidence for clinical decision making. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of SRs and MA for the effects of acupuncture and herbal medicine on infertility was conducted using nine databases. Two independent reviewers extracted the data of the selected SR and MA and evaluated their methodological quality using the 'Assessment of multiple systematic reviews 2 (AMSTAR2)'. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in this analysis. Eight studies were published in China, and three studies each were published in the USA, UK, and Australia. Conflicting evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture for infertile women has been reported. Herbal medicine for infertile women undergoing ART, women with anovulation, and women with polycystic ovary syndrome helped improve the clinical pregnancy rate. The methodological quality of SRs and MAs evaluated by AMSTAR 2 was low or very low because the protocol or list of excluded studies were omitted. Conclusion: Herbal medicine tended to be effective in infertility, but acupuncture had low evidence of an effect on infertility. The methodological quality of the published SRs and MAs was underestimated because AMSTAR2 is a more rigorous assessment tool than the previous version.","Affiliations 1 Department of Preventive Medicine, Dongguk University Graduate School of Korean Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. 2 Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Dongguk University, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea. 3 College of Korean Medicine, Dongguk University, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea. 4 Department of Korean Obstetrics and Gynecology, Dongguk University Ilsan Oriental Hospital, Goyang, Republic of Korea.","Jang Won Lee , Min Kyung Hyun , Hye Jin Kim , Dong-Il Kim ",Integr Med Res,2021 Sep,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33665092
888,Kushenol C Prevents Tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide and Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury,"Sophora flavescens, also known as Kushen, has traditionally been used as a herbal medicine. In the present study we evaluated the ameliorative effects of kushenol C (KC) from S. flavescens against tBHP (tert-Butyl hydroperoxide)-induced oxidative stress in hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG2) cells and acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. KC pretreatment protected the HEPG2 cells against oxidative stress by reducing cell death, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. KC pretreatment also upregulated pro-caspase 3 and GSH (glutathione) as well as expression of 8-Oxoguanine DNA Glycosylase (OGG1) in the HEPG2 cells. The mechanism of action was partly related by KC's activation of Akt (Protein kinase B (PKB)) and Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) in the HepG2 cells. In in vivo investigations, coadministration of mice with KC and APAP significantly attenuated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and liver damage, as the serum enzymatic activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, as well as liver lipid peroxidation and cleaved caspase 3 expression, were reduced in APAP-treated mice. Coadministration with KC also up-regulated antioxidant enzyme expression and prevented the production of proinflammatory mediators in APAP-treated mice. Taken together, these results showed that KC treatment has potential as a therapeutic agent against liver injury through the suppression of oxidative stress.","Affiliations 1 Research Institute, Ato Q&A Co., LTD, Jeonju-si 55069, Korea. 2 Institute of Health Science, Jeonju University, Jeonju-si 55069, Korea. 3 Department of Herbal Crop Research, National Institute of Horticultural & Herbal Science, RDA, Eumsung 27709, Korea. 4 Department of Health Management, Jeonju University, Jeonju-si 55069, Korea.","Byoung Ok Cho , Jang Hoon Kim , Denis Nchang Che , Hyun Ju Kang , Jae Young Shin , Suping Hao , Ji Hyeon Park , Feng Wang , Yun Ji Lee , Seon Il Jang ",Molecules,2021 Mar 15,"Acetaminophen / adverse effects*,Alanine Transaminase / metabolism,Animals,Antioxidants / physiology,Aspartate Aminotransferases / metabolism,Cell Line, Tumor,Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic / drug therapy*,Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic / metabolism,Glutathione / metabolism,Hep G2 Cells,Herbal Medicine / methods,Humans,Lipid Peroxidation / drug effects,Liver / drug effects*,Liver / metabolism,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred BALB C,NF-E2-Related Factor 2 / metabolism,Oxidative Stress / drug effects,Plant Extracts / pharmacology*,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt / metabolism,Reactive Oxygen Species / metabolism,Signal Transduction / drug effects,Sophora / chemistry*,tert-Butylhydroperoxide / adverse effects*,Antioxidants,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,Plant Extracts,Reactive Oxygen Species,Acetaminophen,tert-Butylhydroperoxide,Aspartate Aminotransferases,Alanine Transaminase,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt,Glutathione",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33804228
889,Rheumatology-led pregnancy clinic: patient-centred approach,"Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs), which include all types of inflammatory arthritis as well as systemic Lupus, are known to have a detrimental effect on both fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Consequently, reproductive health care is considered a principle constituent of comprehensive care for all patients with rheumatic ailments seen in the standard practice. Whilst pregnancy-associated complications have been reported in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's syndrome, in some conditions such as lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, inflammatory myopathies, and vasculitis, the pregnancy may accelerate the disease progression. Furthermore, the activity of some diseases such as lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome may be augmented by some contraceptive methods. Therapeutically, some patients are prescribed medications, such as methotrexate and mycophenolate which have potentially teratogenic effect. Therefore, to be able to help those patients, family planning should be patient-centred with decision-making tailored to the individual's disease status. For those healthcare professionals interested in reproductive health care for their patients living with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, this review summarizes the available information in the literature and offers practical suggestions of patient-centred care in a dedicated rheumatology-led pregnancy clinic. Key Points • Autoimmune disorders, particularly systemic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, affect many women, often during childbearing age. • Pregnancies in this cohort of patients with rheumatic diseases is considered to be of high risk, because of the potential for complications during periods of active disease and the possible impact of medications used on both the pregnancy outcomes as well as the baby. • There are high chances of successful and safe pregnancies particularly if pre-pregnancy planning and screening for maternal and fetal risks are undertaken, and pregnancy takes place while the disease is well controlled. Encouraging the patients, who are in their childbearing period, to initiate discussions about family planning and pregnancy, with their treating rheumatologists, would be an ideal approach to close this gap of information exchange. • Targeted patients' education is expected to improve the information quality and promote more collaborative decision-making with regard to motherhood and healthcare choices.","Affiliations 1 King's College London, London, UK. yasser.el-miedany@nhs.net. 2 Rheumatology Department, North Middlesex University Hospital, London, UK.","Yasser El Miedany , Deborah Palmer ",Clin Rheumatol,2021 Oct,"Review,Autoimmune Diseases*,Contraception,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Rheumatic Diseases* / drug therapy,Rheumatology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33759082
890,Female reproductive abnormalities in mouse adolescent pregnancy,"There are around 300 million adolescent pregnancies worldwide, accounting for 11% of all births worldwide. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that many adverse perinatal outcomes are associated with adolescent pregnancies. However, how and why these abnormalities occur remain to be defined. In this study, pregnancy at different stages was compared between 25- and 30- day-old and mature female mice. We found that the litter size of adolescent pregnancy is significantly decreased from F1 to F3 generations compared to mature pregnancy. On days 8 and 12 of pregnancy, multiple abnormalities in decidual and placental development appear in F3 adolescent pregnancy. On days 5 and 8, uterine endoplasmic reticulum stress is dysregulated in F3 adolescent pregnancy. Embryo implantation and decidualization are also compromised in adolescent pregnancy. Many genes are abnormally expressed in adolescent estrous uteri. The abnormal endocrine environment and abnormal implantation from uterine immaturity may result in multiple pregnancy failures in adolescent pregnancy. The aim of this study is to shed light on human adolescent pregnancy.","Affiliation 1 College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.","Chen Yang , Yue Li , Hai-Yang Pan , Meng-Yuan Li , Ji-Min Pan , Si-Ting Chen , Hai-Yi Zhang , Zhen-Shan Yang , Hai-Ting Dou , Zeng-Ming Yang ",Reproduction,2021 Oct 5,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Animals,Decidua,Embryo Implantation,Female,Humans,Mice,Placenta,Pregnancy,Pregnancy in Adolescence*,Reproduction,Uterus",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34486978
891,Maternal adverse childhood experiences and pregnancy intentions,"Purpose: The current study investigates the association between maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and having an unwanted (i.e., a pregnancy that was undesired) or mistimed pregnancy (i.e., a pregnancy that occurred sooner than wanted). Methods: Data are from the 2018 North Dakota and South Dakota Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) (N = 1897). Multinomial logistic regression analyses are used to assess the association between levels of ACE exposure and having an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy relative to an intended pregnancy. Results: Findings demonstrated that women with three ACEs (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR] = 2.157, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.121-4.151) and four or more ACEs (RRR = 1.836, 95% CI, 1.181-2.854) had approximately twice the relative risk of having an unwanted pregnancy (vs. an intended pregnancy) compared to women with 0 ACEs. There was no association between ACEs and reporting a mistimed pregnancy. Conclusions: These findings add to a burgeoning literature detailing how accumulating ACEs can create challenges for family planning by increasing the likelihood of having an unintended pregnancy. Study results suggest the need to devote greater resources to the prevention of ACEs and unintended pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Criminology & Criminal Justice, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio.

892,Double Trouble: Complications in Twin Pregnancies,"With the increasing rate of twin pregnancies due to increase in maternal age and use of assisted reproduction, it is important to be aware of unique diseases which occur specifically to twin pregnancies, especially in monochorionic twin pregnancies. These entities include twin to twin transfusion syndrome, twin anemia polycythemia sequence, twin reversed arterial perfusion, cotwin demise, and conjoined twins. Early evaluation and documentation are imperative to guide management which ultimately leads to better patient outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. 2 Department of Radiology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM. 3 Department of Radiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.","Sherry S Wang , Jonathan Revels , Theodore J Dubinsky ",Ultrasound Q,2020 Sep,"Review,Twin Study,Female,Fetofetal Transfusion / diagnostic imaging*,Fetofetal Transfusion / embryology*,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Twins, Conjoined / embryology*,Ultrasonography, Prenatal / methods*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32890327
893,Cardiovascular function during triplet pregnancy,"Pregnancy is recognized as a natural physiological stressor to the maternal cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular adaptation is markedly greater in twin pregnancy compared with singleton pregnancy; however, these changes are sparsely documented in triplet pregnancy. The aim of this case series was to compare maternal cardiac function, cardioautonomic regulation, and blood pressure reactivity in healthy singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies. Resting cardiac structure and function (echocardiography), beat-by-beat blood pressure variability (BPV; photoplethysmography), and heart rate variability (HRV; electrocardiogram) were measured in two triplet, three twin, and three singleton pregnancies (matched for maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index, and gestational age). Hemodynamic responses to a 3-min cold pressor test were also recorded to assess blood pressure reactivity. Due to the small sample size of this case series, statistical comparisons were not made between groups. Compared with singleton and twin pregnancies, individuals pregnant with triplets had greater resting cardiac output but lower cardiac deformation (longitudinal strain, basal circumferential strain, and torsion), sympathetic dominance in cardioautonomic regulation (lower HRV and higher BPV), and elevated blood pressure reactivity in response to the cold pressor test. Taken together, these observations suggest that females with triplet pregnancies may have reduced cardiovascular function, which may contribute to the heightened risk of complications in multifetal pregnancies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Individuals with healthy triplet pregnancies had greater resting cardiac output but lower left ventricular mechanics when compared with singleton and twin pregnancies matched for gestational age. In addition, triplet pregnancies had greater blood pressure variability and lower overall heart rate variability compared with singleton pregnancies, as well as greater blood pressure reactivity to the cold pressor test. Healthy triplet pregnancies may have reduced cardiovascular function as well as a greater sympathetic contribution to cardiac control.","Affiliations 1 Program for Pregnancy and Postpartum Health, Physical Activity and Diabetes Laboratory, Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation, Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Alberta Diabetes Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 2 Department of Medicine, Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 3 Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 4 Division of Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Fetal and Neonatal Cardiology Program, Women's and Children Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 5 Neurovascular Health Lab, Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.","Victoria L Meah , Rshmi Khurana , Lisa K Hornberger , Craig D Steinback , Margie H Davenport ",J Appl Physiol (1985),2021 Apr 1,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Triplet*,Pregnancy, Twin,Triplets,Twins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33507851
894,"Newborn Sleep: Patterns, Interventions, and Outcomes","Sleep is a necessary function of life. Fetuses and neonates spend most of their day sleeping, making it paramount to place emphasis on adequate and optimal sleep. As the current body of literature continues to expand, we have increased our understanding of sleep and its role in development. Sleep disturbances, particularly early in life can affect all aspects of health such as neurological development, emotional well-being, and overall growth. This article aims to provide a primer on sleep development from fetal life into the neonatal period, discuss sleep in both the home and hospital settings, explore the tools used to measure sleep, and review common interventions applied to those infants experiencing poor sleep. Lastly, there is a mention of long-term outcomes and how early recognition and implementation of measures could help to improve overall growth and development throughout childhood.

895,Effects of nutritional status on serum fetuin-A level,"Fetuin-A is a glycoprotein structured molecule which is mostly released by the liver. As a multifunctional protein, fetuin-A has positive effects on health such as calcification, cardiovascular diseases and tumor development processes with various mechanisms, whereas it plays a negative role in the processes of obesity, diabetes and fatty liver disease. There are a large number of studies reporting that serum fetuin-A levels are affected by several dietary factors. It is reported in some of these studies that several nutrients increase fetuin-A release, while some others have adverse effects. It is put forward that some nutrients such as dairy products, curcumin, niacin, palmitate, coffee and alcohol consumption decrease fetuin-A level, and dietary omega-3 fatty acids intake may increase fetuin-A concentration. In addition, it is indicated that high blood glucose levels increase hepatic fetuin-A release by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 enzymes and increased plasma free fatty acids do the same effect by increasing NF-KB activity. Despite these studies in the literature, there is not any review evaluating fetuin-A, chronic diseases and nutrition together. Therefore, in this study, the relationship between serum fetuin levels and some diseases and the effects of nutrients on fetuin A levels were investigated with possible mechanisms.","Affiliation 1 Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.","Mehmet Arif Icer , Hilal Yıldıran ",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,2020,"Review,Chronic Disease,Diet*,Humans,Noncommunicable Diseases*,Nutrients,Nutritional Status*,Obesity,alpha-2-HS-Glycoprotein / analysis*,alpha-2-HS-Glycoprotein",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31232084

Importantly, recent trials have shown that malnutrition is indeed a modifiable risk factor with specific individualised nutritional support interventions started at hospital admission having positive effects on the risk of complications, mortality, functional outcomes, rehospitalisation and quality of life. Understanding the optimal use of nutritional support in patients with acute illness is complex &ndash; as timing, route of delivery, and the amount and type of nutrients can all affect patient outcome. The aim of this narrative review is to provide a practical guideline for pragmatic and evidence-based assessment and treatment of medical inpatients at nutritional risk. We thereby focus on screening, patient assessment, definition of individual nutritional goals and nutritional support interventions that help patients to reach these goals.","Affiliations 1 Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Clinical Nutrition, University Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Aarau, Switzerland. 2 Medical Faculty of the University of Basel, Switzerland. 3 Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Clinical Nutrition, University Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Aarau, Switzerland / Department of Health Professions, Bern University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland. 4 Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Clinical Nutrition, University Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Aarau, Switzerland / The New York Academy of Sciences, New York, NY, USA. 5 Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, Nutritional Medicine and Metabolism, Bern University Hospital, and University of Bern, Switzerland. 6 Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Clinical Nutrition, University Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Aarau, Switzerland / Medical Faculty of the University of Basel, Switzerland.","Annic Baumgartner , Nina Kägi-Braun , Pascal Tribolet , Filomena Gomes , Zeno Stanga , Philippp Schuetz ",Swiss Med Wkly,2020 Apr 15,"Review,Humans,Inpatients*,Malnutrition* / therapy,Nutrition Assessment,Nutritional Status,Nutritional Support,Quality of Life",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32294220
897,Natural abundance carbon isotope ratio analysis and its application in the study of diet and metabolism,"Due to differences in carbon assimilation pathways between plants, there are subtle but distinct variations in the carbon isotope ratios of foods and animal products throughout the food supply. Although it is well understood that the carbon isotope ratio composition of the diet influences that of the consumers' tissues, the application of natural abundance carbon isotope ratio analysis in nutrition has long been underappreciated. Over the past decade, however, several studies have investigated the utility of carbon isotope ratio analysis for evaluation of nutritional biomarker status, primarily focusing on its application as an objective indicator of sugar and animal protein intake. More recently, research investigating the application of natural abundance measurements has been extended to study fatty acid metabolism and has yielded encouraging results. Collectively, data from large-scale observational studies and experimental animal studies highlight the potential for carbon isotope ratio analysis as an additional and effective tool to study diet and metabolism. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of natural abundance carbon isotope ratio analysis, its application to studying nutrition, and an update of the research in the field.","Affiliations 1 Dell Pediatric Research Institute, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA. 2 Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.","R J Scott Lacombe , Richard P Bazinet ",Nutr Rev,2021 Jul 7,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Animals,Biomarkers* / analysis,Carbon Isotopes* / analysis,Diet*,Humans,Metabolism*,Nutritional Sciences* / methods,Nutritional Status,Biomarkers,Carbon Isotopes",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33141222

899,Herbal medicine and pattern identification for treating COVID-19: a rapid review of guidelines,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and has caused illness to many people worldwide. This review aimed to summarize and analyze the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines for their pattern identifications (PIs) and compositions of herbs to treat patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19. Results: Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines. After standardizing the terminology of the PIs and herbal formulae, there were 8 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 11 PIs and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage, 8 PIs and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 6 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage in the Chinese guidelines. In the Korean guidelines, there were 4 PIs and 15 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 3 PIs and 3 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 2 PIs and 2 herbal formulae for the recovery stage. In the frequency analysis of herbs, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma was found to be the herb with the highest frequency of usage in the Chinese guidelines.

900,NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT OF LIVER CIRRHOSIS AND ITS COMPLICATIONS IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS,"Background: Cirrhosis is a chronic and progressive liver disease that occurs from prolonged hepatocellular injury. Malnutrition causes complications in cirrhosis patients that worsen the condition to liver failure. Both are closely linked and increase the chances of morbidity and mortality. Regular nutritional screening and monitoring is prime concern for such patients including comprehensive dietary history, laboratory tests, and evaluation of muscle loss and strength capabilities to determine the degree of frailty. For efficient assessment of liver cirrhosis patients Subjective Global Assessment has been used worldwide. The nutritional objectives for such individuals should be to regain liver functions, to prevent complications associated, and to overcome nutritional deficiencies causing malnutrition. Methods: We conducted a literature review using PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct for this purpose, a total of 130 articles were reviewed out of which 80 (from the past 5 years) including originally published research, review articles and abstracts were also included. Exclusion criteria of the selected studies was year of publication, irrelevancy and animal studies based on the purpose of current study. The aim of this study was to check nutritional management in patients having complications of liver cirrhosis. Results: According to the guidelines, for the conservation of normal nutritional status of the malnourished patients', energy should be provided 35 kcal/kg/day while to prevent hypoalbuminemia and maintain the protein stores in the body, 1.5 g/kg/day protein has been recommended. Carbohydrates and fats for cirrhosis patients are recommended 50% to 60% and 10% to 20% of the total dietary intake respectively. Conclusion: Initial identification and prevention of malnutrition have the probability to lead to better health outcomes, prevention of complications of the disease, and improving quality of life.","Affiliations 1 University Institute of Diet and Nutritional Sciences, University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan. 2 College of Allied Health Sciences, Akhtar Saeed Medical and Dental College, Lahore, Pakistan. 3 Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.","Nida Javaid , Ayesha Zafar Iqbal , Maryam Hameeda ",Arq Gastroenterol,2021 Apr-Jun,"Review,Humans,Liver Cirrhosis / complications,Malnutrition* / etiology,Malnutrition* / prevention & control,Nutrition Assessment*,Nutritional Status,Quality of Life",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34287534
901,A retrospective study of twin pregnancy management in mares,"The aim of the study was to compare three methods of reducing twin pregnancy in mares to maintain a single pregnancy. As multiple pregnancies in mare are always undesirable, early ultrasound diagnosis makes possible management of twin pregnancies and extra embryo removal. In years 2010-2018, 16494 mares were sonographically tested for early pregnancy, finding 868 cases of twins (471 bilateral and 397 unilateral). 260 mares with a confirmed bilateral tween pregnancy were subjected to manual crushing of one embryo and administration of flunixin at a dose of 1.1 mg/kg BW. 186 mares were subjected only to the embryo crushing procedure. 25 mares from this group were on a restrictive diet. In the unilateral twin pregnancy mare group, 62 were subjected to manual embryo reduction with simultaneous treatment with flunixin, 60 had only manual embryonic vesicle crush and 210 had a restrictive diet. Determination of success, measured as the development of a single pregnancy, were monitored 2 weeks after the procedure, between the 50th and 60th day of pregnancy and after the 90th day of pregnancy. In general, warm-blooded mares were more prone to a twin pregnancy, and at the same time, all the procedures used to reduce it to a single pregnancy caused a greater risk of losing both embryos than in the case of cold-blooded mares. The beneficial effect of administering flunixin after manual removal of one embryo on the maintenance of the other has been experimentally proven in both unilateral and bilateral twin pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Animal Reproduction with Clinic, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, UWM Olsztyn, Oczapowskiego 13, 10-718, Olsztyn, Poland.

902,Outcome of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objectives: To explore the outcome of monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twin pregnancies affected by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for studies reporting the outcome of MCMA twin pregnancies complicated by TTTS. The primary outcome was intrauterine death (IUD); secondary outcomes were miscarriage, single IUD, double IUD, neonatal death (NND), perinatal death (PND), survival of at least one twin, survival of both twins and preterm birth (PTB) before 32 weeks' gestation. Outcomes were assessed in MCMA twins affected by TTTS not undergoing intervention and in those treated with amniodrainage, laser therapy or cord occlusion. Subgroup analysis was performed including cases diagnosed before 24 weeks. Random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was used to analyze the data. Results: Fifteen cohort studies, including 888 MCMA twin pregnancies, of which 44 were affected by TTTS, were included in the review. There was no randomized trial comparing the different management options in MCMA twin pregnancies complicated by TTTS. In cases not undergoing intervention, miscarriage occurred in 11.0% of fetuses, while the incidence of IUD, NND and PND was 25.2%, 12.2% and 31.2%, respectively. PTB complicated 50.5% of these pregnancies. In cases treated by laser surgery, the incidence of miscarriage, IUD, NND and PND was 19.6%, 27.4%, 7.4% and 35.9%, respectively, and the incidence of PTB before 32 weeks' gestation was 64.9%. In cases treated with amniodrainage, the incidence of IUD, NND and PND was 31.3%, 13.5% and 45.7% respectively, and PTB complicated 76.2% of these pregnancies. Analysis of cases undergoing cord occlusion was affected by the very small number of included cases. Miscarriage occurred in 19.2%, while there was no case of IUD or NND of the surviving twin. PTB before 32 weeks occurred in 50.0% of these cases. Conclusions: MCMA twin pregnancies complicated by TTTS are at high risk of perinatal mortality and PTB. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the optimal type of prenatal treatment in these pregnancies. Copyright © 2019 ISUOG.

903,Sleep in ostrich chicks (Struthio camelus),"It has been reported that adult ostriches displayed the longest episodes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (up to 5 min) and more REM sleep (24% of the nighttime) than any other bird species. If the mammalian ontogenetic trend exists in the ostrich, then the amounts of REM and the duration of sleep episodes in young ostriches may be greater than those reported in adults. We investigated sleep in 1.5-3.5 month old ostrich chicks. Recordings were conducted during nighttime (20:00-08:00), the main sleep period in ostriches, which are diurnal. The polygrams were scored in 4-s epochs for waking, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep, as in other bird studies. REM sleep in ostrich chicks occurred during both cortical EEG activation and during slow waves, as was described in adult ostriches. The chicks spent 69.3% ± 1.5% of the night in NREM sleep. REM sleep occupied 14.1% ± 1.8% of the night or 16.8% ± 2.0% of nighttime sleep. Episodes of REM sleep lasted on average 10 ± 1 s and ranged between 4 and 40 s. Therefore, the total amount and duration of REM sleep episodes in ostrich chicks were substantially smaller than reported in adult ostriches while the amounts of NREM sleep did not greatly differ. The developmental profile of REM sleep ontogenesis in the ostrich may be remarkably different from what has been reported in all studied mammals and birds.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA. 2 Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, North Hills, CA. 3 A.N.

They also pose a multitude of challenges and controversies, as outlined in this Review. Moreover, they are less likely to be included in clinical trials. Many issues on classification and management remain under debate. Efforts at standardizing diagnostic criteria, monitoring protocols, management and outcome reporting are likely to reduce their perinatal risks.

907,Changes in Delivery Timing for High-Risk Pregnancies in the United States,"Objective: This study was aimed to assess whether the ""39-week"" rule is being extended to high-risk pregnancies and if so whether this has led to changes in neonatal morbidity or stillbirth. Study design: Birth certificate data between 2010 and 2014 from 23 states (55% of births in the United States) were used. Pregnancies were classified as high risk if they had any one of the following: maternal age greater than or equal to 40 years, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2, chronic (prepregnancy) hypertension, or diabetes (pregestational or gestational). Delivery timing changes for all pregnancies at term (37 weeks or greater) were compared with changes in the high-risk population. Neonatal morbidities (neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] admission, need for assisted ventilation, 5-minute Apgar score, and macrosomia), maternal morbidities (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, cesarean delivery, operative vaginal delivery, chorioamnionitis, and severe perineal laceration), and stillbirth rates were compared across time periods. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze whether gestational age-specific morbidity changes were due to shifts in delivery timing. Results: For the overall population, there was a shift in delivery timing between 2010 and 2014, a 2.5% decrease in 38-week deliveries, and a 2.3% increase in 39-week deliveries (p < 0.01). This gestational age shift was identical in the high-risk population (2.7% decrease in 38-week deliveries and 2.9% increase in 39-week deliveries). For the high-risk population, NICU admission increased from 5.4 to 6.3% in 2014 (p < 0.01) and assisted ventilation rates declined from 3.8 to 2.9% (p < 0.01). These changes, however, were independent of changes in delivery timing. There was no increase in the rate of stillbirth (0.23% in 2010 and 0.23% in 2014; p = 0.50). Conclusion: There was a significant shift in delivery timing for high-risk pregnancies in the United States between 2010 and 2014. This shift, however, did not result in statistically significant changes in either neonatal morbidity or stillbirth. Key points: · From 2010 to 2014, term deliveries for high-risk pregnancies shifted towards 39 weeks.. · The shift towards 39 weeks in high-risk pregnancies was not accompanied by any improvement in neonatal morbidity.. · The shift towards 39 weeks in high-risk pregnancies did not result in an increase in the stillbirth rate..","Affiliations 1 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. 2 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.","Sarah E Little , Julian N Robinson , Chloe A Zera ",Am J Perinatol,2021 Nov,"Body Mass Index,Delivery, Obstetric*,Diabetes, Gestational,Female,Gestational Age*,Humans,Hypertension,Logistic Models,Maternal Age,Pregnancy,Pregnancy in Diabetics,Pregnancy, High-Risk*,Time Factors,United States",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32526779

910,Hyperparathyroidism in Pregnancy: A Review of the Literature,"Importance: Maternal hyperparathyroidism can be associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and fetal mortality. Because the maternal symptoms are typically nonspecific, the disorder may not be recognized leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study was to review the literature on the etiology/prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management (medical and surgical), and the maternal/neonatal complications associated with pregnancies complicated by hyperparathyroidism. Evidence acquisition: A literature search was undertaken by our university librarian using the search engines PubMed and Web of Science. Search terms used included ""hyperparathyroidism"" AND ""pregnancy"" OR ""pregnancy complications"" OR ""maternal."" The number of years searched was not limited, but the abstracts had to be in English. Results: There were 309 abstracts identified, 164 of which are the basis of this review. This includes 137 articles of the 269 individual case reports in the literature since the first case report in 1947. The articles and case reports reviewed the etiology, risk factors, diagnosis, management, complications, and maternal/fetal outcomes of pregnancies complicated by hyperparathyroidism. Conclusions and relevance: Undiagnosed maternal hyperparathyroidism can result in critical maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy. This review highlights what is currently known about hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy to increase the awareness of this serious pregnancy disorder.","Affiliations 1 OB/GYN Resident. 2 Medical Student. 3 MFM Fellow. 4 Associate Professor. 5 Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Arkansas for the Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR. 6 Assistant Professor, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Assistant Professor, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD.","Ryan J Strebeck , Allison M Schneider , Dayna D Whitcombe , Lindsey B Sward , Nafisa K Dajani , Julie R Whittington , Everett F Magann ",Obstet Gynecol Surv,2022 Jan,"Case Reports,Review,Female,Humans,Hyperparathyroidism* / complications,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications* / diagnosis,Pregnancy Complications* / etiology,Pregnancy Outcome,Prenatal Care",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994393
911,Alternative medicine and herbal remedies in the treatment of erectile dysfunction: A systematic review,"Objectives: To systematically review and discuss the current evidence from placebo-controlled clinical trials that investigated the use of alternative medicines and herbal remedies in the management of erectile dysfunction (ED). Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-based systematic review using specific keyword combinations was conducted on the PubMed and Scopus databases. Randomised controlled trials investigating herbal medicine in at least one group and using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) as an outcome in patients primarily diagnosed with ED were included for review. Results: Following the literature search, screening and eligibility analysis, a total of 42 articles were included. The 42 articles were categorised as single herb extractions (n = 14), combination herbal formula (n = 5), combination of herbal formula and non-herbal nutraceuticals (n = 7), non-herbal nutraceuticals (n = 5), acupuncture and moxibustion (n = 2), diet and nutrition (n = 3), exercise (n = 5), and topical treatments (n = 1). Based on the results, Korean ginseng, Pygnogenol and Prelox, Tribulus terrestris, Lepidium meyenii, L-arginine, acupuncture and lifestyle interventions were the more predominantly investigated treatments interventions for ED. Conclusions: Panax ginseng, Pygnogenol, Prelox and Tribulus terrestris have promising evidence as herbal products, alongside L-arginine as a nutritional supplement, for ED based on IIEF outcomes, and warrant further clinical investigation. The mechanisms of action remain unclear, but each of these appears to in part increase nitric oxide synthesis. Importantly, improved diet and exercise should be considered, particularly in patients with obesity or diabetes mellitus.","Affiliations 1 School of Natural Medicine, Faculty of Community and Health Sciences, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa. 2 American Center for Reproductive Medicine, Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.","Kristian Leisegang , Renata Finelli ",Arab J Urol,2021 Jun 11,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552783
912,Sleep leadership in the army: A group randomized trial,"Objectives: Examine impact of training military leaders in sleep health on leaders and unit members. Design: Following a baseline survey, two-person platoon leadership teams were randomly assigned by company to a training or waitlist control condition. After training, leadership teams completed a post-training survey. Six weeks later, leaders and unit members completed a final survey. Setting: Classroom-style areas on a US military base. Participants: US soldiers (76 leaders and 448 unit members) from 39 platoons across 14 companies in a brigade combat team. Intervention: One-hour training in sleep leadership. Measurements: Leaders were surveyed about sleep knowledge, sleep attitudes, sleep training, sleep quantity, sleep quality and sleep problems. Unit members were surveyed about sleep leadership behaviors, sleep hours, sleep quality and sleep problems. Results: Leaders rated the training highly and most knowledge and some attitudes about sleep improved from the baseline to post-training survey. Fewer leaders in the training condition reported sleep problems at follow-up than those in the waitlist control condition; there were no differences in sleep hours or sleep quality. More unit members with leaders in the training condition reported that their leaders engaged in sleep leadership behaviors at least sometimes and reported sleeping at least 7 hours/24 hours period than did unit members in the waitlist control condition; sleep quality and sleep problems did not differ by condition. Conclusions: Results suggest a simple training intervention targeting leaders may be able to shift sleep health and the cultural perspective on sleep across an organization.","Affiliations 1 Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA.

913,Interferon alpha for essential thrombocythemia during 34 high-risk pregnancies: outcome and safety,"Purpose: Pregnancies in women with essential thrombocythemia (ET) are at a higher risk for obstetrical complications. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are common options to prevent miscarriages and maternal complications, whereas interferon alpha (IFN) seems to be the cytoreductive therapy of choice. This retrospective study analyzes the largest number of IFN pregnancies to date in terms of outcome and safety. Methods: Data of 34 high-risk pregnancies in 23 women presenting at the University hospitals of Minden and Jena from 01-Jun-2007 to 01-Jun-2020 were collected. Reasons defining high-risk ET pregnancy in all 23 patients were: Thrombosis (n = 9) or severe hemorrhage (n = 2) in history, platelet count ≥ 1500 × 103/µl (n = 8) or severe microcirculatory disturbances not completely responding to ASA (n = 4). Results: Without the use of IFN, live birth rate was 60% (6/10), however, after the use of IFN live birth rate increased to 73.5% (25/34 pregnancies). Nine pregnancies ended in miscarriages (9/34; 26.5%); all of them spontaneous abortions. Live birth rate significantly improved with ASA (90% versus 50%, p = 0.0168), however, if ASA and LMWH was added (n = 14), live birth rate was 100%. IFN compound (PEGylated versus standard IFN) and JAK2-driver mutation had no impact on pregnancy outcome. One major maternal complication occurred as a major peripartal bleeding after abortion curettage. Conclusion: IFN was associated with an encouraging live birth rate of 73.5% with no fatal maternal events and manageable side effects.","Affiliations 1 University Clinic for Haematology, Oncology, Haemostaseology and Palliative Care, Johannes Wesling Medical Center Minden, UKRUB, Ruhr-University Bochum, Minden, Germany. lukasjacob.schrickel@muehlenkreiskliniken.de. 2 Department of Internal Medicine 2, Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Jena, Germany. 3 Internal Medicine C, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany. 4 University Clinic for Haematology, Oncology, Haemostaseology and Palliative Care, Johannes Wesling Medical Center Minden, UKRUB, Ruhr-University Bochum, Minden, Germany.","Lukas Schrickel , Florian H Heidel , Parvis Sadjadian , Tatjana Becker , Vera Kolatzki , Andreas Hochhaus , Martin Griesshammer , Kai Wille , German Study Group MPN, GSG-MPN",J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,2021 May,"Abortion, Spontaneous / metabolism,Abortion, Spontaneous / prevention & control,Adult,Aspirin / therapeutic use,Female,Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight / therapeutic use,Humans,Interferon-alpha / therapeutic use*,Janus Kinase 2 / metabolism,Platelet Count / methods,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, High-Risk / drug effects*,Pregnancy, High-Risk / metabolism,Retrospective Studies,Thrombocythemia, Essential / drug therapy*,Thrombocythemia, Essential / metabolism,Young Adult,Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight,Interferon-alpha,Janus Kinase 2,Aspirin",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33140210
914,"Changes in the modes of twin birth in Victoria, 1983-2015","Objectives: To examine changes in the modes of delivery of twins in Victoria over 33 years. Design: Retrospective population-based study. Setting, participants: All twin births in Victoria, 1 January 1983 - 31 December 2015. Major outcomes: Mode of birth (vaginal, planned or unplanned caesarean delivery); indications for caesarean delivery. Results: During 1983-2015, 32 187 twin pregnancies ended in live or stillbirths in Victoria. The proportion of twins born by caesarean delivery increased from 24% (156 twin deliveries) in 1983 to 71% (782 deliveries) in 2015. The proportion of twin births by planned caesarean delivery with twin pregnancy as the sole indication for caesarean delivery increased across this period from 1.8% (12 twin deliveries) to 21% (231 deliveries). The proportion of twin births by caesarean delivery and the proportion of caesarean twin deliveries with twin pregnancy as the principal indication each differed between Victorian regions. Conclusion: During 1983-2015, the proportion of twins born in Victoria by caesarean delivery increased almost threefold, mostly because caesarean delivery has become the preferred mode of birth for twin pregnancies. Regional differences in the delivery of twins suggest that the number of caesarean deliveries can be reduced with appropriate system and training support.","Affiliations 1 Monash University, Melbourne, VIC. 2 Mercy Hospital for Women, Melbourne, VIC. 3 Monash Health, Melbourne, VIC. 4 Safer Care Victoria, Victoria Department of Health and Human Services, Melbourne, VIC.","Yizhen Amy Liu , Mary-Ann Davey , Rilka Lee , Kirsten R Palmer , Euan M Wallace ",Med J Aust,2020 Feb,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cesarean Section / statistics & numerical data*,Cesarean Section / trends*,Evidence-Based Medicine,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Logistic Models,Parturition,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, Twin / statistics & numerical data*,Retrospective Studies,Victoria,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31713879
915,Positive Role of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Cancer Immune Regulation,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) plays a critical role in treating cancer patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is the main component of CAM. TCM, especially Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM), has been increasingly used in China, some other Asian countries and European countries. It has been proven to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted-therapy, and immunotherapy. It lessens the damage caused by these therapies. CHM functions on cancer by inhibiting tumor progression and improving an organism's immune system. Increasing evidence has shown that many CHM exert favorable effects on the immune regulation. We will summarize the role of CHM on patient's immune system when treating cancer patients. Our evidence reveals that single herbs, including their extracts, compound formulations, and preparations, will provide current advances on CHM study, especially from the perspective of immune regulation and novel insights for CHM application in clinic. The main herbs used to treat cancer patients are health-strengthening (Fu-Zheng) herbs and pathogen eliminating (Qu-Xie) herbs. The key mechanism is regulating the immune system of cancer patients. Firstly, health-strengthening herbs are mainly functioned as immune regulatory effectors on cancer. Secondly, some of the compound formulations mainly strengthen the health of patients by regulating the immune system of cancer patients. Lastly, some Chinese medicine preparations are widely used to treat cancer for their properties of spiriting vital energy and anti-cancer effects, mainly by improving immunity. CHM plays a positive role in regulating patients' immune system, which helps cancer patients to fight against cancer itself and finally improves patients' life quality.","Affiliations 1 Department of Oncology, Clinical and Basic Research Team of TCM Prevention and Treatment of NSCLC, The Second Clinical College of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510120, P.

916,Activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling: An important molecular mechanism of herbal medicine in the treatment of atherosclerosis via the protection of vascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress,"Introduction: Recently, Nrf2/HO-1 has received extensive attention as the main regulatory pathway of intracellular defense against oxidative stress and is considered an ideal target for alleviating endothelial cell (EC) injury. Objectives: This paper aimed to summarized the natural monomers/extracts that potentially exert protective effects against oxidative stress in ECs. Methods: A literature search was carried out regarding our topic with the keywords of ""atherosclerosis"" or ""Nrf2/HO-1"" or ""vascular endothelial cells"" or ""oxidative stress"" or ""Herbal medicine"" or ""natural products"" or ""natural extracts"" or ""natural compounds"" or ""traditional Chinese medicines"" based on classic books of herbal medicine and scientific databases including Pubmed, SciFinder, Scopus, the Web of Science, GoogleScholar, BaiduScholar, and others. Then, we analyzed the possible molecular mechanisms for different types of natural compounds in the treatment of atherosclerosis via the protection of vascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress. In addition, perspectives for possible future studies are discussed. Results: These agents with protective effects against oxidative stress in ECs mainly include phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids. Most of these agents alleviate cell apoptosis in ECs due to oxidative stress, and the mechanisms are related to Nrf2/HO-1 signaling activation. However, despite continued progress in research on various aspects of natural agents exerting protective effects against EC injury by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, the development of new drugs for the treatment of atherosclerosis (AS) and other CVDs based on these agents will require more detailed preclinical and clinical studies. Conclusion: Our present paper provides updated information of natural agents with protective activities on ECs against oxidative stress by activating Nrf2/HO-1. We hope this review will provide some directions for the further development of novel candidate drugs from natural agents for the treatment of AS and other CVDs.","Affiliation 1 School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611130, PR China.","Qing Zhang , Jia Liu , Huxinyue Duan , Ruolan Li , Wei Peng , Chunjie Wu ",J Adv Res,2021 Jul 6,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Atherosclerosis* / drug therapy,Endothelial Cells / metabolism,Heme Oxygenase-1 / metabolism,Herbal Medicine,Humans,NF-E2-Related Factor 2 / metabolism,Oxidative Stress,Pharmaceutical Preparations*,NF-E2-Related Factor 2,Pharmaceutical Preparations,Heme Oxygenase-1",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35024180

This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: Twelve databases were searched through 12 May 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 were eligible. The study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for the assessment of the risk of bias in all included RCTs. Mean differences (MDs), risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect sizes of the studies were pooled. Results: Seven RCTs with a total of 855 patients were included. All included trials compared the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine to Western medicine alone. The combined therapy significantly improved the total effective rate (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.34, p < 0.001), cough symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89, p = 0.005), and sputum production symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.50, p = 0.004). Beneficial effects of the combined therapy were also seen in TCM syndrome score of cough (MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.34 to -1.03, p < 0.001), fever (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.45, p < 0.001), dry and sore throat (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.20, p = 0.009), and fatigue (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.17, p = 0.007). The overall risk of bias of the included studies was unclear. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine were found, and revealed the potential role of herbal medicine in treating COVID-19. More high-quality RCTs are needed to further validate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.","Affiliations 1 Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, Korea. 2 Korean Convergence Medicine, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea. 3 Global Strategy Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, Korea. 4 Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Daejeon University, Daejeon 34520, Korea. 5 Herbal Medicine Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, Korea.","Lin Ang , Eunhye Song , Hye Won Lee , Myeong Soo Lee ",J Clin Med,2020 May 23,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32456123
918,Sleep changes following intensive cognitive activity,"Studies over the last 40 years have mainly investigated sleep structure changes as a result of wake duration, in the frame of the classical sleep regulation theories. However, wake intervals of the same duration can profoundly differ in their intensity, which actually reflects the degree of cognitive and physical activity. Data on how sleep can be modified by wake intensity changes (initially sparse and of little consistence) have become much more substantial, especially in the frame of the intense research debate on sleep-memory relationships. Our aim is to examine the vast repertoire of sleep modifications that depend on waking cognitive manipulations, highlighting the sleep features that appear most affected. By systematically addressing this issue, we want to set the basis for future research exploring both the specific nature of the mechanisms involved and the applicative psychosocial and clinical fall-outs, in terms of possible behavioural interventions for sleep quality improvement.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychology, University of Campania ""L.

919,Poisoning by Medical Plants,"Background: Herbal medications are becoming increasingly popular with the impression that they cause fewer side effects in comparison with synthetic drugs; however, they may considerably contribute to acute or chronic poisoning incidents. Poison centers receive more than 100000 patients exposed to toxic plants. Most of these cases are inconsiderable toxicities involving pediatric ingestions of medicinal plants in low quantity. In most cases of serious poisonings, patients are adults who have either mistakenly consumed a poisonous plant as edible or ingested the plant regarding to its medicinal properties for therapy or toxic properties for illegal aims. Methods: In this article, we review the main human toxic plants causing mortality or the ones which account for emergency medical visits. Articles addressing ""plant poisoning"" in online databases were listed in order to establish the already reported human toxic cases. Results: The current review introduces herbal plants toxicity and herb-drug interactions to warn the health professionals about possible consequences of unconscious uses of medicinal plants. The reported cases extracted from our prepared database were classified on the basis of the main toxic effects of plants, and the most prominent constituents of the plants which are responsible for specific toxic effects. Conclusion: Considering the long history of consumption of herbal medicines in different societies, people may wrongly think that medicinal plants are fully harmless and nontoxic. Prescription, preparation and consumption regulations of medicinal plants are not clear and strict as well as their marketing regulations that differ from country to country. The extensive and various consumption of medicinal plants without adequate observation is the most important reason for poisoning by medicinal plants.","Affiliations 1 Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Health Institute, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. 2 Toxicology and Diseases Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center (PSRC), The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), and School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 3 Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria, Bulgaria. 4 Department of Biotechnology, College of Engineering and Technology, BPUT, Bhubaneswar 751003, Odisha, India. 5 Research Institute of Biotechnology & Medical Converged Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyangsi 10326, Republic of Korea.","Mohammad Hosein Farzaei , Zahra Bayrami , Fatemeh Farzaei , Ina Aneva , Swagat Kumar Das , Jayanta Kumar Patra , Gitishree Das , Mohammad Abdollahi ",Arch Iran Med,2020 Feb 1,"Review,Adult,Animals,Herbal Medicine / methods,Humans,Plants, Medicinal / adverse effects,Plants, Medicinal / poisoning*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32061075
920,Herbal Medicines For Treatment of Androgenic Alopecia,"Backgrounds: Androgenic alopecia is a common and unpleasant problem that directly influences the self-confidence and individual life quality. There are various treatment choices that currently are used by people suffering from androgenic alopecia. Drug therapies (e. g. minoxidil, finasteride, dutasteride, prostaglandin analogues, ketoconazole, Cyproterone acetate and spironolactone), Laser-light treatment, surgical treatment, cell mediated treatment and alternative treatments (vitamin, mineral and herbal components) are common therapeutic methods suggested for management of androgenic alopecia. Herbal medicines are now commonly used all over the world and this has increased global demand. Quality, safety and efficacy of these drugs have become a serious concern. Objectives: The aim of this review is evaluating the herbal or fungal medicines were used in androgenic alopecia and introducing the phytochemicals, biological effects, responsible constituents and the mechanism of this action.

921,Development and evaluation of standardized pregnancy identification and trimester distribution algorithms in U.S. IBM MarketScan® Commercial and Medicaid data,"Objectives: Creation of new algorithms to identify pregnancies in automated health care claims databases is of public health importance, as it allows us to learn more about medication use and safety in a vulnerable population. Previous algorithms were largely created using international classification of disease codes, but despite the U.S. code transition in 2015, few algorithms are available with the latest ICD-10-CM codes. Methods: Using U.S. IBM MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters and Multi-State Medicaid databases for women aged 10-64 years during 2014 and 2016, two pregnancy algorithms (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) were created using expert clinical review. The algorithms were evaluated by assessing the distribution of pregnancy outcomes (live birth and pregnancy losses) within each time-based cohort and the ability of the algorithms to identify select medication use during pregnancy. Medication exposure, demographics, comorbidities, and pregnancy outcomes were compared to published literature estimates for the two time periods. Results: For the IBM MarketScan® Commercial database, the algorithms identified 687,228 pregnancies in 2014 and 444,293 in 2016. In the IBM MarketScan® Medicaid database, 389,132 pregnancies in 2014 and 406,418 in 2016 were identified. Percentages of most pregnancy outcomes identified using the algorithms were similar to national data sources; however, percentages of preterm births and pregnancy losses were not comparable. Most medication use estimates from the algorithms were similar to or higher than published estimates. Conclusions: By incorporating the latest ICD-10-CM codes, the new algorithms provide more complete estimates of medication use during pregnancy than algorithms using the outdated codes.","Affiliations 1 Value Evidence Outcomes Epidemiology, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. 2 Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. 3 Access and Customer Engagement Strategy Pricing, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.","Kelsey M Sumner , Anna Ehlinger , Mary E Georgiou , Keele E Wurst ",Birth Defects Res,2021 Nov 15,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Algorithms,Cohort Studies,Databases, Factual,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Medicaid*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome* / epidemiology,United States",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34523818
922,Herbal Therapy for the Management of Seborrheic Dermatitis: A Narrative Review,"Introduction: Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD) are similar skin conditions with different degrees ofseverity. Since the current therapies cannot remove dandruff efficiently, herbal extracts with better effectiveness and fewer side effects are used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Due to the adverse effects of chemical drugs, the use of natural products and traditional medicine has significantly increased over the past few decades. Therefore, in this review, we reported the herbs used as anti-dandruff agents in traditional medicine worldwide. Methods: The review was conducted on the literature available on the medicinal utility of certain plants as anti-dandruff agents using PubMed and Google Scholar and the following search terms: Dandruff and plants or medicinal plant and dandruff treatment, and essential oil and dandruff. Results: Since the current therapies cannotefficiently remove dandruff, herbal extracts with better effectiveness and fewer side effects are used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Nowadays, there are numerous different types of herbal antidandruff shampoos. They are effective and safe without the side effects of chemical agents. Recently, herbal medicine has attracted a great deal of scientific attention. Clinical evidence on the therapeutic effects of herbal products has resulted in the study of far more herbs for their therapeutic roles. Conclusion: Herbal therapy plays a significant role in the development of favorable therapeutics, either alone or in combination with conventional antibiotics. However, the major challenges in this regard include finding compounds with satisfactorily lower MICs, low toxicity, and high bioavailability for effective and safe use in humans and animals.","Affiliations 1 Center for Research and Training in Skin Diseases and Leprosy, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran,Iran. 2 Department of Medical Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran,Iran. 3 School of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center (PSRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran,Iran.","Azin Ayatollahi , Alireza Firooz , Ensieh Lotfali , Faraz Mojab , Mahsa Fattahi ",Recent Adv Antiinfect Drug Discov,2021,"Review,Dandruff* / drug therapy,Dermatitis, Seborrheic* / drug therapy,Humans,Medicine, Traditional,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Phytotherapy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35026970
923,A pilot study on essential oil aroma stimulation for enhancing slow-wave EEG in sleeping brain,"Sleep quality is important to health and life quality. Lack of sleep can lead to a variety of health issues and reduce in daytime function. Recent study by Fultz et al. also indicated that sleep is crucial to brain metabolism. Delta power in sleep EEG often indicates good sleep quality while alpha power usually indicates sleep interruptions and poor sleep quality. Essential oil has been speculated to improve sleep quality. Previous studies also suggest essential oil aroma may affect human brain activity when applied awake. However, those studies were often not blinded, which makes the effectiveness and mechanism of aroma a heavily debated topic. In this study, we aim to explore the effect of essential oil aroma on human sleep quality and sleep EEG in a single-blinded setup. The aroma was released when the participants are asleep, which kept the influence of psychological expectation to the minimum. We recruited nine young, healthy participants with regular lifestyle and no sleep problem. All participants reported better sleep quality and more daytime vigorous after exposing to lavender aroma in sleep. We also observed that upon lavender aroma releases, alpha wave in wake stage was reduced while delta wave in slow-wave sleep (SWS) was increased. Lastly, we found that lavender oil promote occurrence of SWS. Overall, our study results show that essential oil aroma can be used to promote both subjective and objective sleep quality in healthy human subjects. This makes aroma intervention a potential solution for poor sleep quality and insomnia.","Affiliations 1 Center for Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-Devices (IDS2B), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan. lwko@nctu.edu.tw. 2 Institute of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan. lwko@nctu.edu.tw. 3 Drug Development and Value Creation Research Center, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. lwko@nctu.edu.tw. 4 Center for Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-Devices (IDS2B), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan. 5 Institute of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu City, Taiwan. 6 Sleep Center, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan. 7 Department of Psychiatry, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan. 8 Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.","Li-Wei Ko , Cheng-Hua Su , Meng-Hsun Yang , Shen-Yi Liu , Tung-Ping Su ",Sci Rep,2021 Jan 13,"Randomized Controlled Trial,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Brain / drug effects*,Brain / physiology,Electroencephalography,Female,Humans,Lavandula,Male,Oils, Volatile / pharmacology*,Pilot Projects,Plant Oils / pharmacology*,Single-Blind Method,Sleep / drug effects*,Sleep / physiology,Sleep, Slow-Wave / drug effects*,Sleep, Slow-Wave / physiology,Surveys and Questionnaires,Young Adult,Oils, Volatile,Plant Oils,lavender oil",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33441798
924,Simultaneous Use of Herbal Medicines and Antihypertensive Drugs Among Hypertensive Patients in the Community: A Review,"In various countries, approximately 80% of patients use herbal medicine, both in single form or in combination with antihypertensive drugs, for the treatment of hypertension. Therefore, this research summarized studies on the simultaneous use of herbal medicines and antihypertensive drugs among hypertensive patients in the community. A literature search was conducted on PubMed in April 2020, and the following keywords were used: ""herbal medicines"" and ""antihypertensive patients."" In total, 15 of 263 articles were found to be eligible in the initial research. Results showed that studies were performed in different countries worldwide including America and those in Europe, Asia, and Africa between 1960 and 2020. The factors associated with the use of herbal medicines and antihypertensive drugs were age, gender, education level, income, and residence. Herbal medicines and antihypertensive drugs are simultaneously utilized primarily due to their safety and high efficacy. Herbal medicine is frequently recommended by friends or colleagues, herbalists, advertisements, and health workers. Garlic is the most common herbal medicine used along with antihypertensive drugs. The side effects of combination therapy with herbal medicines and prescription drugs for the management of antihypertension include shortness of breath and cough, ulcers, diarrhea, knee cramps, and abdominal discomfort. The lack of communication between patients and health care workers could cause an increase in the simultaneous use of herbal medicines and antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, effective communication among health care workers and appropriate care are important in preventing the side effects and other risks of combined therapy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, West Java, 45363, Indonesia. 2 Muhammadiyah Kuningan Institute of Health Science, Cigugur-Kuningan, West Java, 45551, Indonesia. 3 Center of Excellence in Higher Education for Pharmaceutical Care Innovation, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, West Java, 45363, Indonesia. 4 Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, West Java, 45363, Indonesia.","Nur Azizah , Eli Halimah , Irma Melyani Puspitasari , Aliya Nur Hasanah ",J Multidiscip Healthc,2021 Feb 3,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33568913

926,"What Is ""Normal"" Infant Sleep? Why We Still Do Not Know","The human need for sleep is universal and unquestioned; however, humans vary in their sleep needs according to age, individual differences, as well as cultural and social norms and practices. Therefore, what is ""normal"" in infant sleep and the development of sleep architecture in humans is highly dependent on biological and sociocultural variables as well as socially constructed assumptions about what infant sleep ""should"" look like. This paper uses a multidisciplinary approach to review papers from fields including pediatrics, anthropology, psychology, medicine, and sociology to understand ""normal"" infant sleep. Because human culture and behavioral practice changes much more quickly than evolved human biology, and because human evolutionary history occurred in the context of breastfeeding and cosleeping, new work in the field of infant sleep architecture development would benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. To come to a consensus about what is ""normal"" infant sleep, researchers must agree on underlying basic assumptions of infant sleep from which to ask question and interpret findings.","Affiliation 1 Human Development and Family Studies, 33700Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus, Lemont Furnace, PA, USA.",Elaine S Barry ,Psychol Rep,2021 Apr,"Review,Biological Evolution,Breast Feeding,Humans,Infant,Sleep / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32138610
927,Sleep-Wake Neurochemistry,"Behavioral states naturally alternate between wakefulness and the sleep phases rapid eye movement and nonrapid eye movement sleep. Waking and sleep states are complex processes that are elegantly orchestrated by spatially fine-tuned neurochemical changes of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators including glutamate, acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, hypocretin, melanin concentrating hormone, adenosine, and melatonin. However, as highlighted in this brief overview, no single neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, but rather their complex interactions within organized neuronal ensembles, regulate waking and sleep states. The neurochemical pathways presented here are aimed to provide a conceptual framework for the understanding of the effects of currently used sleep medications.","Affiliations 1 Neuroscience and Rare Diseases Discovery and Translational Area, Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Basel, Grenzacherstrasse 124, Basel 4070, Switzerland.

928,Systematic screening for vasa previa at the 20-week anomaly scan,"Introduction: The presence of vasa previa carries a high risk for severe fetal morbidity and mortality due to fetal bleeding caused by injury to unprotected fetal vessels when rupture of membranes occurs. Previously, it has been shown that prenatal diagnosis significantly improves the outcome. However, systematic screening for vasa previa is not generally performed and clinical studies demonstrating the performance of systematic screening for vasa previa in routine clinical practice are rare. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of systematic screening for vasa previa by determining placental cord insertion at the 20-week anomaly scan. Material and methods: This is a retrospective study of 6038 pregnant women between 18+0 and 24+0 gestational weeks who were prospectively screened for vasa previa by depiction of the site of placental cord insertion at the 20-week anomaly scan. Pregnancies with marginal or velamentous cord insertion underwent vaginal sonography for examination for vasa previa. In cases with succenturiate or bilobed placentas, the bridging vessels were depicted, and vaginal sonography was performed if necessary. Results: There were 21 cases of vasa previa and all were diagnosed prenatally. In 18 cases, the cord insertion was marginal or velamentous. The remaining three cases had placental anomalies, which necessitated a detailed examination. All pregnancies with vasa previa were delivered at a mean of 35.2 (SD 1.8) gestational weeks by cesarean section. Among pregnancies affected by vasa previa, all fetuses survived. The median birthweight was 2390 g (range 1200-2990 g) and the mean umbilical artery pH 7.34 (SD 0.04). The median 5-min APGAR score was nine (range 7-10). None of the fetuses or neonates died or required blood transfusions. In all pregnancies of the whole cohort which were complicated by fetal or neonatal demise and in neonates with a 5-min APGAR score ≤5 and/or an umbilical artery pH ≤7.10, fetal blood loss was excluded as a cause of the poor obstetric outcome. Conclusions: Screening for vasa previa is feasible and efficient, taking into account the site of placental cord insertion in pregnancies not affected by placenta previa and bilobed and succenturiate placenta.","Affiliations 1 Ambulatorium für Fetalmedizin Feldkirch, Feldkirch, Austria. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinical Center, Klagenfurt, Austria.","Anna Gross , Barbara Markota Ajd , Christian Specht , Matthias Scheier ",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,2021 Sep,"Evaluation Study,Adult,Female,Humans,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy Trimester, Second,Prospective Studies,Retrospective Studies,Ultrasonography, Prenatal*,Vasa Previa / diagnostic imaging*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34077551
929,Spindles are highly heritable as identified by different spindle detectors,"Study objectives: Sleep spindles, a defining feature of stage N2 sleep, are maximal at central electrodes and are found in the frequency range of the electroencephalogram (EEG) (sigma 11-16 Hz) that is known to be heritable. However, relatively little is known about the heritability of spindles. Two recent studies investigating the heritability of spindles reported moderate heritability, but with conflicting results depending on scalp location and spindle type. The present study aimed to definitively assess the heritability of sleep spindle characteristics. Methods: We utilized the polysomnography data of 58 monozygotic and 40 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs to identify heritable characteristics of spindles at C3/C4 in stage N2 sleep including density, duration, peak-to-peak amplitude, and oscillation frequency. We implemented and tested a variety of spindle detection algorithms and used two complementary methods of estimating trait heritability. Results: We found robust evidence to support strong heritability of spindles regardless of detector method (h2 > 0.8). However not all spindle characteristics were equally heritable, and each spindle detection method produced a different pattern of results. Conclusions: The sleep spindle in stage N2 sleep is highly heritable, but the heritability differs for individual spindle characteristics and depends on the spindle detector used for analysis.","Affiliations 1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. 2 Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, Centre de Recherche de l'Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de Montréal, QC, Canada. 3 Division of Sleep Medicine/Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. 4 YRT Ltd, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. 5 Sleep Disorders Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. 6 Department of Medicine, Corporal Michael J.

930,Decoding Brain Responses to Names and Voices across Different Vigilance States,"Past research has demonstrated differential responses of the brain during sleep in response especially to variations in paralinguistic properties of auditory stimuli, suggesting they can still be processed ""offline"". However, the nature of the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we therefore used multivariate pattern analyses to directly test the similarities in brain activity among different sleep stages (non-rapid eye movement stages N1-N3, as well as rapid-eye movement sleep REM, and wake). We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (own vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice) salience in 16 healthy sleepers during an 8-h sleep opportunity. Paralinguistic salience (i.e., familiar vs. unfamiliar voice) was reliably decoded from EEG response patterns during both N2 and N3 sleep. Importantly, the classifiers trained on N2 and N3 data generalized to N3 and N2, respectively, suggesting similar processing mode in these states. Moreover, projecting the classifiers' weights using a forward model revealed similar fronto-central topographical patterns in NREM stages N2 and N3. Finally, we found no generalization from wake to any sleep stage (and vice versa) suggesting that ""processing modes"" or the overall processing architecture with respect to relevant oscillations and/or networks substantially change from wake to sleep. However, the results point to a single and rather uniform NREM-specific mechanism that is involved in (auditory) salience detection during sleep.","Affiliations 1 Cognition and Consciousness Research, Laboratory for Sleep, Department of Psychology, University of Salzburg, Hellbrunner Strasse 34, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. 2 Transfaculty Research Platform Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences, University of Basel, Birmannsgasse 8, CH-4055 Basel, Switzerland. 3 Centre for Chronobiology, Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Basel, Wilhelm-Klein-Str. 27, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland. 4 Department of Health Sciences, Università Degli Studi di Milano, 20146 Milan, Italy.","Tomasz Wielek , Christine Blume , Malgorzata Wislowska , Renata Del Giudice , Manuel Schabus ",Sensors (Basel),2021 May 13,"Brain,Electroencephalography*,Sleep,Sleep Stages,Wakefulness*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34068077
931,The Positive Role and Mechanism of Herbal Medicine in Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, manifested by the progressive functional impairment of the midbrain nigral dopaminergic neurons. Due to the unclear underlying pathogenesis, disease-modifying drugs for PD remain elusive. In Asia, such as in China and India, herbal medicines have been used in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease for thousands of years, which recently attracted considerable attention because of the development of curative drugs for PD. In this review, we first summarized the pathogenic factors of PD including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, ion accumulation, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, and the related recent advances. Secondly, we summarized 32 Chinese herbal medicines (belonging to 24 genera, such as Acanthopanax, Alpinia, and Astragalus), 22 Chinese traditional herbal formulations, and 3 Indian herbal medicines, of which the ethanol/water extraction or main bioactive compounds have been extensively investigated on PD models both in vitro and in vivo. We elaborately provided pictures of the representative herbs and the structural formula of the bioactive components (such as leutheroside B and astragaloside IV) of the herbal medicines. Also, we specified the potential targets of the bioactive compounds or extractions of herbs in view of the signaling pathways such as PI3K, NF-κB, and AMPK which are implicated in oxidative and inflammatory stress in neurons. We consider that this knowledge of herbal medicines or their bioactive components can be favorable for the development of disease-modifying drugs for PD.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Pediatrics, Department of Neonatology, Developmental and Behavioral Pediatric Department & Child Health Care Department, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. 2 Center for Clinical Research and Translational Medicine, Department of Neurology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. 3 Tenth People's Hospital of Tongji University, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.","Rong Yin # , Jie Xue # , Yanfeng Tan , Chuantao Fang , Chunchun Hu , Qian Yang , Xinyu Mei , Dashi Qi ",Oxid Med Cell Longev,2021 Sep 3,"Review,Animals,Herbal Medicine / methods*,Humans,Neuroprotective Agents / pharmacology,Parkinson Disease / drug therapy*,Parkinson Disease / pathology,Phytotherapy / methods*,Neuroprotective Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34567415

Since Chinese herbal medicine is widely used for the treatment of stroke, there is a need to evaluate its efficacy as an alternative treatment option. The aim of this paper is to carry out an overview of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of stroke by summarizing and evaluating all existing Cochrane reviews. Methods: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched from its inception date to August 2019 using ""stroke"" and ""herbal medicine"" or ""traditional medicine"" as search terms. For the methodological quality assessment of the Cochrane reviews, the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool was used. Results: Eight Cochrane reviews that evaluated the efficacy of herbal medicine for the treatment of stroke were included in this overview. There were 71 randomized controlled trials, with 5770 patients in total. The AMSTAR scores of the Cochrane reviews included in this study ranged from 9 to 11 with a mean score of 10. Three reviews met all the 11-item criteria of the AMSTAR. All reviews presented potential efficacy of herbal medicine for stroke treatment in terms of improvement of neurological deficit. Conclusion: This overview reveals the potential efficacy of herbal medicines for the treatment of stroke in terms of neurological deficit improvement. However, due to the high risk of bias in the reviews' studies, an affirmative conclusion for the recommendation of herbal medicine for clinical practice could not be drawn.","Affiliations 1 The Center for Evidence-based Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. 2 Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. 3 Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea. 4 Korean Convergence Medicine, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea. 5 Global Strategy Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea. 6 Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Daejeon University, Daejeon, Korea.","Maoling Wei , Deren Wang , Deying Kang , Myeong Soo Lee , Tae-Young Choi , Lin Ang , Eunhye Song ",Integr Med Res,2020 Mar,Review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31908922

We examined 150 electronic files of oncology patients referred to an IP consultation for demographic and cancer-related data; use of herbal medicine for disease-related outcomes; and narratives of patients and informal caregivers describing their expectations from the IP consultation. Over half (51.3%) of patients reported using herbal medicine for disease-related outcomes, more so among those adopting dietary changes for this goal (P < .005). Most (53.3%) were accompanied by an informal caregiver, especially those using herbal medicine (66.2%, P = .002) or adopting dietary changes (69.8%, P < .001). The majority of patients (84.4%) expected the IP to provide guidance on the use of herbal medicine for disease-related outcomes (e.g., ""curing,"" ""shrinking,"" ""eradicating"" and ""cleansing""). Most caregivers (88.8%) expressed a similar expectation, with some having additional questions not mentioned by the patient. IPs need to identify and understand expectations of oncology patients and their informal caregivers, helping them make informed decisions on the effective and safe use of herbal medicine. The IP may need to ""reframe"" expectations regarding the ability of herbal medicine to treat cancer and immunity, to more realistic quality of life-focused goals.","Affiliations 1 Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. 2 Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. 3 Clalit Health Services, Haifa, Israel. 4 Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.","Noah Samuels , Menachem Oberbaum , Eran Ben-Arye ",Integr Cancer Ther,2021 Jan-Dec,"Caregivers,Complementary Therapies*,Humans,Integrative Oncology*,Motivation,Quality of Life,Referral and Consultation",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33588610
936,Plant genomics in Africa: present and prospects,"Plants are the world's most consumed goods. They are of high economic value and bring many health benefits. In most countries in Africa, the supply and quality of food will rise to meet the growing population's increasing demand. Genomics and other biotechnology tools offer the opportunity to improve subsistence crops and medicinal herbs in the continent. Significant advances have been made in plant genomics, which have enhanced our knowledge of the molecular processes underlying both plant quality and yield. The sequencing of complex genomes of African plant species, facilitated by the continuously evolving next-generation sequencing technologies and advanced bioinformatics approaches, has provided new opportunities for crop improvement. This review summarizes the achievements of genome sequencing projects of endemic African plants in the last two decades. We also present perspectives and challenges for future plant genomic studies that will accelerate important plant breeding programs for African communities. These challenges include a lack of basic facilities, a lack of sequencing and bioinformatics facilities, and a lack of skills to design genomics studies. However, it is imperative to state that African countries have become key players in the plant genome revolution and genome derived-biotechnology. Therefore, African governments should invest in public plant genomics research and applications, establish bioinformatics platforms and training programs, and stimulate university and industry partnerships to fully deploy plant genomics, particularly in the fields of agriculture and medicine.","Affiliations 1 National Center for Scientific and Technical Research, Rabat, Morocco. 2 Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences, Casablanca, Morocco. 3 Covenant University Bioinformatics Research (CUBRe), Covenant University, Ogun State, Km 10 Idiroko Road, P.M.B. 1023, Nigeria. 4 Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana. 5 Laboratory of Plant and Microbial Biotechnology, Biodiversity and Environment, Faculty of Sciences, University Mohammed V, Rabat, Morocco. 6 Department of Biological Sciences, Covenant University, Ogun State, Km 10 Idiroko Road, P.M.B. 1023, Ota, Nigeria. 7 Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Covenant University, Ogun State, Km 10 Idiroko Road, P.M.B. 1023, Ota, Nigeria. 8 Department of Computer Science, Landmark University, Kwara-State, Omu-Aran, Nigeria. 9 Department of Chemistry, Covenant University, Ogun State, Km 10 Idiroko Road, P.M.B. 1023, Ota, Nigeria. 10 College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere University, P.

937,Behavioural sleep in two species of buccal pumping sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Cephaloscyllium isabellum),"Sleep is known to occur in most, if not all, animals studied thus far. Recent studies demonstrate the presence of sleep in flatworms and jellyfish, suggesting that this behaviour evolved early in the evolution of animals. Sharks are the earliest known extant, jawed vertebrates and may play an important role in understanding the evolutionary history of sleep in vertebrates, and yet, it is unknown whether they sleep. The Port Jackson (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) and draughtsboard (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) sharks are both benthic, buccal pumping species and remain motionless for extended periods of time. Whether these periods of prolonged inactivity represent sleep or quiet wakefulness is unknown. A key criterion for separating sleep from other quiescent states is an increased arousal threshold. We show here that inactive sharks of both species require significantly higher levels of electric stimulation before they show a visible response. Sharks deprived of rest, however, show no significant compensatory increase in restfulness during their normal active period following enforced swimming. Nonetheless, increased arousal thresholds in inactive animals suggest that these two species of shark sleep - the first such demonstration for members of this group of vertebrates. Further research, including electrophysiological studies, on these and other sharks, is required for a comprehensive understanding of sleep in cartilaginous fishes.","Affiliations 1 School of Biological Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. 2 Oceans Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. 3 Oceans Graduate School, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. 4 Leigh Marine Laboratory, Institute of Marine Science, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. 5 School of Life Sciences, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia.","Michael L Kelly , Stefan Spreitzenbarth , Caroline C Kerr , Jan M Hemmi , John A Lesku , Craig A Radford , Shaun P Collin ",J Sleep Res,2021 Jun,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Animals,Sharks,Sleep / physiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32672393
938,Adolescent pregnancy and social norms in Zambia,"Early pregnancy occurs frequently in Zambia and is considered a public health issue. The aim of this study was to improve understanding of how gendered sexual norms make young unmarried girls vulnerable to unintended pregnancies in a specific context. It combined individual interviews and focus group discussions with girls and boys aged 13-18 years and the parents of other young people of this same age, with peer interviews with girls aged 13-20 years at four sites in the southern province of Zambia. For girls, sexual relationships and early pregnancies were at odds with dominant norms and were consistently met with disapproval because they led to economic difficulties for young women and their parents, school dropouts and health problems for the young woman and her baby. Lack of resources and insufficient knowledge about sexuality and reproduction, together with gender norms governing sexual behaviour and contraceptive use, combine to place adolescent girls in a vulnerable position with respect to unintended pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Centre for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child Health (CISMAC), Centre for International Health, Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. 2 Chr.

939,Objective rapid eye movement sleep characteristics of recurrent isolated sleep paralysis: a case-control study,"Study objectives: Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (RISP) is a rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia characterized by a dissociative state with characteristics of REM sleep and wakefulness. Pathophysiology has not yet been clarified and very little research has been performed using objective polysomnographic measures with inconsistent results. The main aim of our study was to find whether higher REM sleep fragmentation is consistent with the theory of state dissociation or whether signs of dissociation can be detected by spectral analysis. Methods: A total of 19 participants in the RISP group and 19 age- and gender-matched participants in the control group underwent two consecutive full-night video-polysomnography recordings with 19-channel electroencephalography. Apart from sleep macrostructure, other REM sleep characteristics such as REM sleep arousal index, percentage of wakefulness and stage shifts within REM sleep period were analyzed, as well as power spectral analysis during REM sleep. Results: No difference was found in the macrostructural parameters of REM sleep (percentage of REM sleep and REM latency). Similarly, no significant difference was detected in REM sleep fragmentation (assessed by REM sleep arousal index, percentage of wakefulness and stage shifts within REM sleep). Power spectral analysis showed higher bifrontal beta activity in the RISP group during REM sleep. Conclusions: The results showed an underlying persistent trait of higher cortical activity that may predispose patients with sleep paralysis to be more likely to experience recurrent episodes, without any apparent macrostructural features including higher REM sleep fragmentation.","Affiliations 1 National Institute of Mental Health, Klecany, Czech Republic. 2 Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. 3 Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic.","Monika Kliková , Marek Piorecký , Eva Miletínová , Karolina Janků , Daniela Dudysová , Jitka Bušková ",Sleep,2021 Nov 12,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Case-Control Studies,Electroencephalography,Humans,Polysomnography,Sleep / physiology,Sleep Paralysis* / complications,Sleep Stages / physiology,Sleep, REM* / physiology,Wakefulness / physiology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145456
940,"Identifying the links between consumer food waste, nutrition, and environmental sustainability: a narrative review","Emerging research demonstrates unexpected relationships between food waste, nutrition, and environmental sustainability that should be considered when developing waste reduction strategies. In this narrative review, we synthesize these linkages and the evidence related to drivers of food waste and reduction strategies at the consumer level in the United States. Higher diet quality is associated with greater food waste, which results in significant quantities of wasted resources (e.g., energy, fertilizer) and greenhouse gas emissions. Food waste also represents waste of micronutrients that could otherwise theoretically fill nutritional gaps for millions of people. To make progress on these multiple fronts simultaneously, nutrition professionals must expand beyond their traditional purview, into more interdisciplinary arenas that make connections with food waste and environmental sustainability.","Affiliations 1 Department of Health Sciences, William & Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA. 2 Division of Agriculture, Food, and Environment, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.","Zach Conrad , Nicole Tichenor Blackstone ",Nutr Rev,2021 Feb 11,"Review,Environment*,Food*,Humans,Nutritional Status*,Waste Products*,Waste Products",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32585005
941,Mode of Delivery in Monochorionic Compared With Dichorionic Twin Pregnancies,"Objective: To compare mode of delivery between monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of women undergoing delivery of diamniotic twins in a single maternal-fetal medicine practice in New York City between 2005 and 2021. We compared baseline characteristics and delivery outcomes between monochorionic and dichorionic gestations. The primary outcome was mode of delivery. For monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies at or after 34 weeks of gestation, we also compared neonatal outcomes between women who did and did not attempt vaginal delivery. Data were analyzed using the χ2 test, Fisher exact test, and t test when appropriate. Results: A total of 1,121 diamniotic twin pregnancies were identified, of which 202 (18%) were monochorionic and 919 (82%) were dichorionic. Mode of delivery did not differ between monochorionic and dichorionic pregnancies, both in the overall cohort (cesarean delivery rate 61% vs 63%, P=.54) and in the subgroup of women who attempted vaginal delivery (cesarean delivery rate 22% vs 21%, P=.80). For patients with a vaginal delivery of twin A, the mode of delivery for twin B did not differ between the groups. Among the patients with monochorionic pregnancies at or after 34 weeks of gestation, neonatal outcomes did not differ between women who did and did not attempt vaginal delivery. Conclusion: Monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancies are not at an increased risk of cesarean delivery when compared with their dichorionic-diamniotic counterparts.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland; and Maternal Fetal Medicine Associates, PLLC, and the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.","Henry N Lesser , Andrei Rebarber, Nathan S Fox",Obstet Gynecol,2021 Sep 1,"Comparative Study,Adult,Chorion*,Cohort Studies,Delivery, Obstetric / statistics & numerical data*,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,New York City / epidemiology,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy, Twin*,Prenatal Care*,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34352858
942,Analyzing human sleep EEG: A methodological primer with code implementation,"Recent years have witnessed a surge in human sleep electroencephalography (EEG) studies, employing increasingly sophisticated analysis strategies to relate electrophysiological activity to cognition and disease. However, properly calculating and interpreting metrics used in contemporary sleep EEG requires attention to numerous theoretical and practical signal-processing details that are not always obvious. Moreover, the vast number of outcome measures that can be derived from a single dataset inflates the risk of false positives and threatens replicability. We review several methodological issues related to 1) spectral analysis, 2) montage choice, 3) extraction of phase and amplitude information, 4) surrogate construction, and 5) minimizing false positives, illustrating both the impact of methodological choices on downstream results, and the importance of checking processing steps through visualization and simplified examples. By presenting these issues in non-mathematical form, with sleep-specific examples, and with code implementation, this paper aims to instill a deeper appreciation of methodological considerations in novice and non-technical audiences, and thereby help improve the quality of future sleep EEG studies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany.

943,Multidisciplinary effort to improve the diagnosis of malnutrition in hospitalized patients,"Malnutrition has been increasingly demonstrated to be common and underrecognized in hospitalized patients. Rates have been demonstrated as high as 55%, but the diagnosis of malnutrition has historically been made in only a minority of inpatients. Laboratory studies, including serum prealbumin level, have been shown to have poor predictive value of malnutrition. In 2014, our institution embarked on a system-wide effort to improve diagnosis of malnutrition in hospitalized patients. We adopted the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (AND/ASPEN) Clinical Characteristics and implemented the Nutrition-Focused Physical Exam/Assessment into clinical practice. Dietitians recorded malnutrition diagnoses in a flow sheet in the electronic medical record (EMR) and alerted the primary team when a patient met criteria for malnutrition. An editable link to malnutrition diagnosis was created in the discharge summary templates in the EMR. Over 4 years, these efforts led to an increase in our rate of diagnosis of malnutrition from 6% to 12%, which was sustained over the last 2 years. We also found that the percentage of inpatients having serum prealbumin levels checked decreased from 13% to 8% over the study period. We found that a system-wide, stepwise approach to improving our diagnosis of inpatients with malnutrition was effective and appears sustainable over the period studied. We noted a behavior change for providers in both documenting the condition and decreasing their utilization of laboratory studies as part of their clinical diagnostic workup, thus avoiding unnecessary laboratory draws and leading to potential cost saving.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA. 2 Department of Care Coordination, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA. 3 Department of Nutrition, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.","Jennifer Quartarolo , Analyn Dolopo , Byron Richard ",Nutr Clin Pract,2021 Oct,"Consensus,Dietetics*,Humans,Malnutrition* / diagnosis,Malnutrition* / epidemiology,Nutrition Assessment,Nutritional Status,United States",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33821499
944,Locked twins-remote from term: a case report,"Background: Locked twins is a rare and hazardous obstetric complication, which occurs in approximately 1:100 twin pregnancies. One of the known etiologic factors for locked twins is size of the twins. We report a case of chin-to-chin locked twins that occurred at gestational age of 30 weeks pus 6 days. A 27 years-old primigravida Oromo mother presented with a history of pushing down pain and passage of liquor of 6 hours duration at gestational age of 30 weeks plus 6 days. With a diagnosis of twin pregnancy (first twin non-vertex), abdominal delivery was decided in latent first stage of labor but mother refused caesarian delivery and she was allowed to labor with the hope of achieving a vaginal delivery. In second stage, interlocking twin was encountered and a low vertical cesarean section was done to effect delivery of twins without the need to decapitate the first twin. Conclusion: Locked twin is a rare obstetric complication. Whenever it is encountered, successful delivery can be achieved without the need to have decapitation of the first twin during caesarian section.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. abrahamfessehaye4@gmail.com. 2 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.","Abraham Fessehaye , Ferid A Abubeker , Mekdes Daba ",J Med Case Rep,2021 Mar 12,"Case Reports,Adult,Cesarean Section*,Delivery, Obstetric,Female,Humans,Infant,Labor Presentation*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Retrospective Studies,Twins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33706772
945,The abrupt shift to slower frequencies after arousal from sleep in healthy young adults,"Study objectives: Postarousal hypersynchrony (PAH) is an atypical arousal pattern in children's electroencephalography. PAH is an abrupt shift to slower frequencies in arousal-related responses, appearing as slow-wave clusters. In contrast, the prevalence of PAH in healthy young adults is still unknown. Here, we examined the prevalence and characteristics of PAH in healthy young participants. Methods: Thirty healthy young participants underwent 1 night of polysomnography (13 females, 22.8 ± 2.0 years [mean ± standard deviation]). We examined the prevalence of PAH as a function of sleep stage, sleep cycle, and time course (the first or the second half). The correlation between PAH and sleep variables was examined. The percent of total sleep time in the N3 stage (%N3) was compared for each sleep cycle and time course. Results: Twenty-eight out of 30 participants exhibited PAH (4.6 ± 4.8 times per night). PAH increased significantly during the first sleep cycle and the first half-sleep period. It was observed only in nonrapid eye movement and not in rapid eye movement sleep. The number of PAHs correlated with the number of arousals and arousal indices. The %N3 increased in the first half-sleep and the first sleep cycle. Conclusions: PAH was relatively common in healthy young participants. Since PAH occurred in a state with a high prevalence of %N3, the first sleep cycle, or the first half-sleep, we suggest that PAH may be affected by the sleep homeostasis process. Since PAH occurred only in non-rapid eye movement sleep and correlated with arousal increment, it may have the function of suppressing non-rapid eye movement sleep's cortical arousal.

946,The Copenhagen Primary Care Laboratory Pregnancy (CopPreg) database,"Purpose: The Copenhagen Primary Care Laboratory Pregnancy (CopPreg) database was established based on data from The Danish Medical Birth Register and the Copenhagen Primary Care Laboratory (CopLab) database. The aim was to provide a biomedical and epidemiological data resource for research in early disease programming (eg, parental clinical biomarker levels and pregnancy/ birth outcomes or long-term health in the offspring). Participants: The cohort consisted in total of 203 608 women (with 340 891 pregnancies) who gave birth to 348 248 children and with 200 590 related fathers. In this paper, we focused on women and fathers who had clinical test requisitions prior to and during pregnancy, and on all children. Thus, the cohort in focus consisted of 203 054 pregnancies with requisitions on 147 045 pregnant women, 39 815 fathers with requisitions during periconception and 65 315 children with requisitions. Findings to date: In addition to information on pregnancy and birth health status and general socio-demographic data, over 2.2 million clinically relevant test results were available for pregnancies with requisitions, over 1.5 million for children and over 600 000 test results were available for the fathers with requisitions during periconception. These were ordered by general practitioners in the primary care setting only and included general blood tests, nutritional biomarkers (macronutrients and micronutrients) and hormone tests. Information on tests related to infections, allergies, heart and lung function and sperm analyses (fathers) were also available. Future plans: The CopPreg database provides ready to use and valid data from already collected, objectively measured and analysed clinical tests. With several research projects planned, we further invite national and international researchers to use this vast data resource. In a coming paper, we will explore and discuss the indication bias in our cohort.","Affiliations 1 Danish Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurology, The Neuroscience Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. 2 Research Unit for General Practice and Section of General Practice, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. 3 Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. 4 Research Unit for Dietary Studies, The Parker Institute, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Frederiksberg, Denmark. 5 Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark. 6 Department of Hematology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. 7 Research Unit for General Practice and Section of General Practice, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark Berit.Lilienthal.Heitmann@regionh.dk.","Janet Janbek , Margit Kriegbaum , Mia Klinten Grand , Ina Olmer Specht , Bent Struer Lind , Christen Lykkegaard Andersen , Berit Lilienthal Heitmann ",BMJ Open,2020 May 24,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Child,Databases, Factual,Fathers,Female,Humans,Laboratories*,Male,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications*,Pregnancy Outcome,Primary Health Care*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32448791
947,Pregnancy outcome after first trimester exposure to vortioxetine: A case series,"Background: The objective of this study was to collect outcome after vortioxetine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy in a case series. Methods: Callers who were counseled by the Israeli Teratology Information Service (TIS) regarding vortioxetine exposure during pregnancy were prospectively collected and followed-up by telephone using a structured questionnaire. Outcomes were confirmed by a pediatrician with medical records in the neonatal period. Results: Between 2016 and 2019, a total of 19 women were included in the TIS database after first trimester exposure to vortioxetine. Seventeen pregnancy follow-ups were obtained, while two pregnancies were lost to follow-up. Eleven pregnancies resulted in 12 live births with no malformations including one set of twins; there were three miscarriages, two terminations, and one stillbirth in week 22. One termination was performed due to prenatal diagnosis of acrania (the woman also took carbamazepine, folic acid and dipyrone), and the second due to fear of abnormalities after cystic hygroma was suspected at week 12 with nuchal translucency of 8.1 mm and no further cytogenetic testing. The twins were born in week 35. Two women continued using the medication until delivery; one of these women reported nursing her baby from birth to up to 1 year, while she continued taking vortioxetine. Discussion: This case series provides preliminary outcome data on vortioxetine exposure in pregnancy. However, the small sample size calls for caution in the interpretation of results. Denominator-based studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn.","Affiliations 1 Department of Child Development and Rehabilitation, Medical Management, The Israeli Teratology Information Service, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel. 2 Department of Medical Neurobiology, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.","Siham Shweiki , Orna Diav-Citrin ",Birth Defects Res,2021 Apr 1,"Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Nuchal Translucency Measurement*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome*,Pregnancy Trimester, First,Prenatal Diagnosis,Vortioxetine,Vortioxetine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33463081

950,Outcomes in intervention and management of multiple pregnancies trials: A systematic review,"Objectives: Twin pregnancy has risks of adverse outcomes for mother and baby. Data synthesis is required to gain evidence to aid recommendations but may be hampered by variations in outcome reporting. Study design: Systematically review outcomes reported in twin pregnancy trials (PROSPERO - CRD42019133805). Searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, Cochrane library (inception-January 2019) for randomised control trials or their follow-up studies reporting prediction, prognosis, intervention or management outcomes in twin pregnancy. The study characteristics, outcomes definitions and measurements were extracted and descriptively analysed. Results: 49 RCTs and 8 follow-up studies evaluated 21 interventions, 1257 outcomes, categorised into 170 unique outcomes. 65 % of trials included all twin pregnancies, 12 % DCDA and 11 % MCDA only or MCMA and MCDA. Five (9 %) papers were prediction/ prognosis RCT's and 52 (91 %) related to an intervention. Of interventions, 40 (77 %) were medical, 34 (85 %) for preterm birth; 12 (23 %) surgical, 6 (50 %) related to TTTS interventions (83 % for monochrorionic studies). Commonest domains were: 'Neonatal' 77 %, 'Delivery' 70 % and 'Survival' 67 %. Least reported were longer term outcomes for 'Infant' or 'Parental'. Conclusions: Twin pregnancy outcomes are diverse and complex. This is related to the need to address maternal, single and double fetal outcomes and different types of chorionicity. The lack of outcome standardisation in selection, definition and reporting hinders evidence synthesis and the selection of outcomes important to women and health care professionals thus limiting the effectiveness of research.","Affiliations 1 Institute of Applied Health Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK. 2 University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA. 3 Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK; Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. 4 Institute of Applied Health Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK.

The purpose of this analysis is to describe the scope of NHLBI-funded extramural nutrition research grants over the past decade and offer insights into future opportunities for nutrition research relevant to NHLBI's mission. Methods: Data were extracted using the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization spending categories from the publicly available NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool Expenditures and Results. New 2018 and 2019 grants were coded into categories and mapped to the 2016 NHLBI Strategic Vision priorities. Results: Approximately 90% of nutrition research funds supported extramural grants, particularly through investigator-initiated R series grants (69.6%). Of these, 19.8% were classified as clinical trials. Consistent nutrition-related topics, including physical activity, weight loss, fatty acids, metabolic syndrome, childhood obesity, and other topics such as gut microbiota, arterial stiffness, sleep duration, and meal timing, emerged in 2014-2019. Mapping of the NHLBI Strategic Vision objectives revealed that 32% of newly funded grants focused on pathobiological mechanisms important to the onset and progression of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders, with opportunities including developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and clinical and implementation science research.

952,Pregnancy in women with psoriatic arthritis: A systematic literature review of disease activity and adverse pregnancy outcomes,"Background: There is limited robust evidence on the course of pregnancy and its outcomes in women with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on which to base recommendations for the management of these patients. Objective: The primary objective was to review available data on (I) disease activity during pregnancy and on (II) adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) in women with PsA. Secondly, neonatal outcomes and treatment of the rheumatic disease were investigated. Methods: Systematic literature search within the databases Pubmed and Embase until 30 Nov 2020 was performed. Additionally, reference lists of included studies and of review articles revealed by the search were screened. All full text articles identified and published in English language were systematically evaluated by two reviewers. All studies that reported on one of the primary outcomes and included at least five pregnancies in women with PsA were considered. Results: The review of 734 search results revealed 13 eligible publications reporting on a total of 2,332 pregnancies in women with PsA. Nine studies reported on PsA activity and showed an increase or worsening of disease activity after delivery compared to the pregnancy period. APOs were reported by nine studies. Adjusted analyses of APOs did not show an increased risk for gestational diabetes, small for gestational age and low birth weight in PsA patients in relation to the respective comparator groups. However, there were signals for a higher pre-eclampsia, elective caesarean section and preterm birth risk in PsA pregnancies. Meta-analysis was not performed due to study heterogeneity. Discussion: This review showed a postpartum deterioration of disease activity in women with PsA and no risk elevation for gestational diabetes, small for gestational age and low birth weight. A higher risk for pre-eclampsia, elective caesarean section and preterm birth in PsA pregnancies cannot be ruled out. Differences in the studies investigated limit overall summary statements on disease activity and APOs in women with PsA. Harmonization of study approaches, instruments and outcome reporting is crucial to ensure informed counselling of patients with PsA before, during and after pregnancy that is based on robust data.

953,Pregnancy outcomes in women with primary systemic vasculitis: a retrospective study,"Background/aims: Pregnancies in women with systemic vasculitis constitute high-risk pregnancies, and outcomes vary based on the size of the affected blood vessels. Currently, there is limited data describing pregnancy outcomes in these women. The aim of this paper is to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with large, medium, or small vessel vasculitis to aid preconceptional counseling and inform antepartum and intrapartum care. Methods: We included all women with large-, medium-, or small-vessel vasculitis and documented pregnancies attending high-risk pregnancy clinics at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada between 2001 and 2016. Pregnancy characteristics and outcomes were reported as proportions. Maternal, fetal/neonatal, and obstetric outcomes, stratified by type of vasculitis, were the main outcomes measured. Results: We identified 60 pregnancies in 50 women with systemic vasculitis. These included large-vessel (n = 10), medium-vessel (n = 5), small-vessel [n = 30, of which 16 were AntiNeutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibody (ANCA)-associated and 14 were immune-complex mediated], central nervous system (n = 3), and retinal (n = 2). Although vasculitis flares occurred with large-vessel (3/12), small-vessel (13/36), and retinal (2/3) vasculitis, only one was severe and involved hemoptysis requiring blood transfusion in a woman with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Preeclampsia complicated two pregnancies each with large- (25%) and small- (6%) vessel vasculitis. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) only occurred with small-vessel vasculitis (10, 29.4%). Although seven (26.4%) viable pregnancies resulted in preterm birth, the mean gestational age was over 35 weeks. Conclusion: Although women with systemic vasculitis can have successful pregnancies, they are at increased risk for late preterm birth. In addition, those with small-vessel vasculitis are at increased risk for IUGR and vasculitis flares.","Affiliations 1 Division of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. 2 Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland. 3 Vasculitis Clinic, Division of Rheumatology, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.","Vanessa Nguyen , Danielle Wuebbolt , Christian Pagnoux , Rohan D'Souza ",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,2021 Sep,"Canada,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Premature Birth*,Retrospective Studies,Systemic Vasculitis*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31571516

Implications for nursing practice: NANDA-I, Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC), and Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) linkages facilitate nurses' ability to select nursing outcomes and interventions for patients with nutritional problems.","Affiliations 1 Vanessa Monteiro Mantovani, MSc, RN, is a PhD Student at Graduate Program in Nursing, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and, member of the Nursing Research Group on the Care of Adults and the Elderly (GEPECADI-CNPq), Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. 2 Sue Moorhead, PhD, RN, FAAN, is an Associate Professor and Director for the Center for Nursing Classification & Clinical Effectiveness, College of Nursing, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. 3 Noriko Abe, MSN, is a Coordinator for the Center for Nursing Classification & Clinical Effectiveness, College of Nursing, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.","Vanessa Monteiro Mantovani , Sue Moorhead , Noriko Abe ",Int J Nurs Knowl,2020 Oct,"Dietetics*,Humans,Nutritional Status*,Standardized Nursing Terminology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32181604
955,Women and Pregnancy in Thromboangiitis Obliterans,"Data regarding women and thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) are conflicted, and a few cases of pregnancy have been described. We aimed to describe the interplay between TAO and pregnancies. Among 224 TAO patients, 22.8% were women. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, and outcomes were similar between men and women. Twenty-one (41.2%) women had 48 pregnancies. Thirty-six (75%) pregnancies with on term and complication free delivery occurred. None of the patients experienced a disease flare of TAO during pregnancy. TAO does not seem to affect pregnancy complications, and pregnancy does not seem to interfere with the course of TAO.","Affiliations 1 Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Centre National de Référence des Maladies Autoimmunes Systémiques Rares, Centre National de Référence des Maladies Autoinflammatoires et de l'Amylose, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, APHP, Sorbonne Universités, INSERM, UMR_S 959, Paris, France, alexandre.lejoncour@aphp.fr. 2 Department of Internal Medicine, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France. 3 Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, CHU Lille, Centre National de Référence des Maladies Autoimmunes et Systémiques Rares (Sclérodermie), Lille, France. 4 Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Centre National de Référence des Maladies Autoimmunes Systémiques Rares, Centre National de Référence des Maladies Autoinflammatoires et de l'Amylose, Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, APHP, Sorbonne Universités, INSERM, UMR_S 959, Paris, France.","Alexandre Le Joncour , Olivier Espitia , Simon Soudet , Patrice Cacoub , Marc Lambert , David Saadoun ",J Vasc Res,2021,"Adult,Female,France / epidemiology,Humans,Live Birth,Middle Aged,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications / diagnosis,Pregnancy Complications / epidemiology*,Pregnancy Outcome,Prognosis,Retrospective Studies,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Thromboangiitis Obliterans / diagnosis,Thromboangiitis Obliterans / epidemiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33434911
956,The effects of chronic endometritis on the pregnancy outcomes,"Problem: Chronic endometritis (CE) influences the clinical outcomes of assisted reproductive technology. However, the effect of CE on the pregnancy outcome is still unknown. Method of study: A retrospective case-control study was conducted in a single university. Subjects who conceived by in vitro fertilization within a year after a histological diagnosis of CE under 40 years of age from September 2013 to December 2017 were extracted. The rates of miscarriage, preterm birth, term birth, and live birth per pregnancy according to the presence or absence of CE were analyzed. A logistic regression analysis was performed for miscarriage, preterm birth, term birth, and live birth for eight explanatory variables of seven infertility factors and CE. Results: A total of 39 pregnancies in 38 subjects with non-CE and 35 pregnancies in 32 subjects with CE were ultimately analyzed. The rates of miscarriage, preterm birth, term birth, and live birth per pregnancy were 12.8% and 40.0% (P < .03), 2.6% and 14.3% (P = .1), 84.6% and 45.7% (P < .001) and 84.6% and 57.1% (P < .03) in the Non-CE and CE groups, respectively, although only the analysis for tem birth rate had sufficient power to exclude Type II error. In logistic analysis, CE was a factor affecting the objective variables of miscarriage, term birth, and live birth. Conclusions: The term birth rate among pregnancies decreased mainly due to an increase in miscarriages when CE was detected before pregnancy in patients treated with in vitro fertilization. A histopathological diagnosis of CE adversely affected the term birth rate per pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan. 2 Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine and Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.","Aina Morimune , Fuminori Kimura , Akiko Nakamura , Jun Kitazawa , Akiko Takashima , Tsukuru Amano , Shoji Kaku , Suzuko Moritani , Ryoji Kushima , Takashi Murakami ",Am J Reprod Immunol,2021 Mar,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Abortion, Spontaneous / epidemiology*,Adult,Birth Rate,Case-Control Studies,Chronic Disease,Embryo Implantation,Endometritis / epidemiology*,Female,Humans,Japan / epidemiology,Live Birth,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Retrospective Studies",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33020952
957,Pregnancy outcomes following oocyte donation,"The use of oocyte donation (OD) has increased continuously over the last three decades, and it is now an indispensable part of assisted reproductive technology (ART). With OD, it has become possible to overcome the biological barrier of ovarian follicle pool depletion and the general age-related decline in fertility. This review contains a thorough appraisal of the safety of OD with an analysis of short-term pregnancy outcomes. Salient up-to-date evidence was evaluated, which revealed that in comparison with both IVF with autologous oocytes, and naturally conceived pregnancies, there is: (i) an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preeclampsia; (ii) an increased risk of low birth weight and preterm birth and (iii) an increased risks of obstetric emergencies, following OD treatment. As a precaution, it is therefore highly encouraged to perform only single embryo transfer (SET) and to prescribe prophylactic low-dose aspirin during OD pregnancies.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre Hospital, Kettegaard allé 30, 2650, Hvidovre, Denmark.

958,The provision of nutritional advice and care for cancer patients: a UK national survey of healthcare professionals,"Purpose: People living with and beyond cancer often experience nutrition-related issues and should receive appropriate advice on nutrition that is consistent and evidence based. The aim of this study was to investigate current practice for the provision of nutritional care by healthcare professionals (HCPs) from a UK national survey produced by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cancer and Nutrition Collaboration. Methods: An online survey sent to professional groups and networks included questions on discussing nutrition, providing information, awareness of guidelines, confidence in providing nutritional advice, training and strategies for improving nutritional management. Results: There were 610 HCPs who responded including nurses (31%), dietitians (25%), doctors (31%) and speech and language therapists (9%). The majority of HCPs discusses nutrition (94%) and provides information on nutrition (77%). However, only 39% of HCPs reported being aware of nutritional guidelines, and just 20% were completely confident in providing nutritional advice. Awareness of guidelines varied between the different professional groups with most but not all dietitians reporting the greatest awareness of guidelines and GPs the least (p = 0.001). Those HCPs with a greater awareness of guidelines had received training (p = 0.001) and were more likely to report complete confidence in providing nutritional advice (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Whilst HCPs discuss nutrition with cancer patients and may provide information, many lack an awareness of guidelines and confidence in providing nutritional advice. To ensure consistency of practice and improvements in patient care, there is scope for enhancing the provision of appropriate nutrition education and training.","Affiliations 1 Faculty of Health & Social Sciences, Bournemouth University, 10 St Paul's Lane, Bournemouth BH8 8AJ, UK. jmurphy@bournemouth.ac.uk. 2 School of Sport, Exercise & Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK. 3 NIHR Cancer and Nutrition Collaboration, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK. 4 Nutrition and Dietetics Department, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK. 5 NIHR Nottingham BRC, Nottingham, UK. 6 University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK. 7 Nutrition and Dietetics, Guys and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. 8 The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. 9 Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK. 10 Imperial College, London, UK. 11 Penny Brohn Cancer Care, Bristol, UK. 12 School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.","Jane L Murphy , Fehmidah Munir , Fiona Davey , Laura Miller , Ramsey Cutress , Rhys White , Megan Lloyd , Justin Roe , Carol Granger , Sorrel Burden , Lesley Turner ",Support Care Cancer,2021 May,"Delivery of Health Care / methods*,Female,Health Personnel / standards*,Humans,Male,Neoplasms / diet therapy*,Nutritional Status / physiology*,Nutritional Support / methods*,Surveys and Questionnaires,United Kingdom",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32918612

Pregnancies affected by diabetes often result in abnormal fetal development, including altered growth and nutrient distribution as well as congenital malformations. Prenatal exposure to the diabetic environment places infants at risk for perinatal compromise, complications in the neonatal period, as well as long term metabolic and neurodevelopmental consequences. It is prudent for providers who care for these newborns to be cognizant of these potential complications in order to promptly and appropriately address them.","Affiliations 1 University of South Dakota Sanford School of Medicine, Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 2 Sanford Health, Sioux Falls, South Dakota.","Jacquelyn Em Grev , Kayla M Munger , Sarah M Scott ",S D Med,2020 Jul,"Diabetes Mellitus*,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Mothers,Obesity,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome,Pregnancy in Diabetics*,Prenatal Care",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32805783
960,Malnutrition Screening and Assessment,"Malnutrition is a serious problem with a negative impact on the quality of life and the evolution of patients, contributing to an increase in morbidity, length of hospital stay, mortality, and health spending. Early identification is fundamental to implement the necessary therapeutic actions, involving adequate nutritional support to prevent or reverse malnutrition. This review presents two complementary methods of fighting malnutrition: nutritional screening and nutritional assessment. Nutritional risk screening is conducted using simple, quick-to-perform tools, and is the first line of action in detecting at-risk patients. It should be implemented systematically and periodically on admission to hospital or residential care, as well as on an outpatient basis for patients with chronic conditions. Once patients with a nutritional risk are detected, they should undergo a more detailed nutritional assessment to identify and quantify the type and degree of malnutrition. This should include health history and clinical examination, dietary history, anthropometric measurements, evaluation of the degree of aggression determined by the disease, functional assessment, and, whenever possible, some method of measuring body composition.","Affiliations 1 Intensive Care Unit, Department of Medicina, University Hospital San Jorge, 22004 Huesca, Spain. 2 Faculty of Health and Sports Sciences, University of Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain. 3 Clinical Analysis and Biochemistry Service, Department of Medicina, University Hospital San Jorge, 22004 Huesca, Spain. 4 Unit of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Medicina, University Hospital San Jorge, 22004 Huesca, Spain.","Carlos Serón-Arbeloa , Lorenzo Labarta-Monzón , José Puzo-Foncillas , Tomas Mallor-Bonet , Alberto Lafita-López , Néstor Bueno-Vidales , Miguel Montoro-Huguet ",Nutrients,2022 Jun 9,"Review,Humans,Malnutrition* / diagnosis,Malnutrition* / therapy,Nutrition Assessment*,Nutritional Status,Nutritional Support,Quality of Life",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35745121
961,Retrospective evaluation of attempted vaginal deliveries in dichorionic twin pregnancies,"Purpose: Numbers of planned cesarean deliveries are increasing in twin pregnancies, despite the lack of evidence for this approach, and the second twin is thought to be at risk for a poorer outcome. The aim of this study was to examine whether twins have a poorer outcome if an attempted vaginal delivery is changed to a cesarean section or combined delivery. Methods: This retrospective data analysis included all women with dichorionic twin pregnancies attempting vaginal delivery over a 10-year period. Outcome parameters for the first and second twins relative to their mode of birth were compared. A correlation model between the interdelivery time interval and Apgar scores was calculated. Subgroup analyses assessing the birth mode of the first and second twins were conducted. Results: A total of 248 women were enrolled in the study. The second twins had significantly lower values for outcome parameters, such as umbilical artery cord pH and Apgar scores in comparison with the first twins (P < 0.01). The subgroup analysis of birth modes in first and second twins showed a significantly poorer outcome in the cesarean section and combined delivery group (P < 0.05). The interdelivery time interval was significantly longer in the second twin cesarean section group (P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation between the interdelivery time intervals and Apgar scores (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Although outcome parameters were significantly lower in second twins and twins born via secondary cesarean section, the clinical relevance of this appears to be negligible.","Affiliations 1 Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecological Endocrinology, Kepler University Hospital, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstrasse 69, 4040, Linz, Austria. sabine.enengl@kepleruniklinikum.at. 2 Department of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Gynecological Endocrinology, Kepler University Hospital, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Altenbergerstrasse 69, 4040, Linz, Austria. 3 Department of General Surgery, Pyhrn-Eisenwurzen Klinikum Steyr, Steyr, Austria. 4 Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Konventhospital Barmherzige Brueder Linz, Linz, Austria.","Sabine Enengl , Peter Oppelt , Simon-Hermann Enzelsberger , Philip Sebastian Trautner , Omar Shebl , Birgit Brandl , Richard Bernhard Mayer ",Arch Gynecol Obstet,2021 Jun,"Twin Study,Apgar Score,Austria / epidemiology,Cesarean Section / statistics & numerical data*,Delivery, Obstetric / methods,Delivery, Obstetric / statistics & numerical data*,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / epidemiology,Pregnancy, Multiple*,Pregnancy, Twin*,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Twins",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33222039

963,"Chance of live birth: a nationwide, registry-based cohort study","Study question: Does the sequence of prior pregnancy events (pregnancy losses, live births, ectopic pregnancies, molar pregnancy and still birth), obstetric complications and maternal age affect chance of live birth in the next pregnancy and are prior events predictive for the outcome? Summary answer: The sequence of pregnancy outcomes is significantly associated with chance of live birth; however, pregnancy history and age are insufficient to predict the outcome of an individual woman's next pregnancy. What is known already: Adverse pregnancy outcomes decrease the chance of live birth in the next pregnancy, whereas the impact of prior live births is less clear. Study design, size, duration: Nationwide, registry-based cohort study of 1 285 230 women with a total of 2 722 441 pregnancies from 1977 to 2017. Participants/materials, setting, methods: All women living in Denmark in the study period with at least one pregnancy in either the Danish Medical Birth Registry or the Danish National Patient Registry. Data were analysed using logistic regression with a robust covariance model to account for women with more than one pregnancy. Model discrimination and calibration were ascertained using 20% of the women in the cohort randomly selected as an internal validation set. Main results and the role of chance: Obstetric complications, still birth, ectopic pregnancies and pregnancy losses had a negative effect on the chance of live birth in the next pregnancy. Consecutive, identical pregnancy outcomes (pregnancy losses, live births or ectopic pregnancies) immediately preceding the next pregnancy had a larger impact than the total number of any outcome. Model discrimination was modest (C-index = 0.60, positive predictive value = 0.45), but the models were well calibrated. Limitations, reasons for caution: While prior pregnancy outcomes and their sequence significantly influenced the chance of live birth, the discriminative abilities of the predictive models demonstrate clearly that pregnancy history and maternal age are insufficient to reliably predict the outcome of a given pregnancy. Wider implications of the findings: Prior pregnancy history has a significant impact on the chance of live birth in the next pregnancy. However, the results emphasize that only taking age and number of losses into account does not predict if a pregnancy will end as a live birth or not. A better understanding of biological determinants for pregnancy outcomes is urgently needed.

966,Is vagal-nerve stimulation safe during pregnancy? A mini review,"Background: Vagus-nerve stimulation (VNS) is the most common neuromodulation technique and has been approved by the FDA for treating refractory epilepsy and refractory depression. Although VNS has been used for nearly 32 years, the impact of VNS on the safety of pregnant women and neonate remains to be evaluated. Methods: We first analyze the relationship between the vagus nerve and the reproductive system (ovary and uterus) and then determine whether harm is inflicted to the reproductive system, thereby affecting the pregnancy. A comprehensive literature search is performed on PubMed/MEDLINE database, Web of Science, and Scopus. Ten articles are included in the study, and 44 pregnancies of 38 patients are analyzed. Results: The vagus nerve is connected with the reproductive system, but VNS may have little effect on pregnancy. We analyze 10 articles (38 patients with 44 pregnancies) about VNS complications during pregnancy. Two of the 44 pregnancies (2/44, 4.5 %) are miscarriages, and two pregnancies have fetuses with congenital malformations (2/42, 4.8 %), which could also be attributed to polytherapy with antiepileptic drugs. The rest of the pregnant women have no postpartum complications, and their fetuses are healthy. Conclusions: VNS may be relatively safe and effective for the fetus and mother during pregnancy, and turning off VNS during pregnancy is unnecessary. However, owing to the small sample size and short follow-up time in the present study, further research is needed.","Affiliations 1 Ningxia Key Laboratory of Cerebrocranial Disease, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, China.

However, currently nutrition was shown to be insufficiently integrated into medical education, regardless of the country. Without an adequate nutrition education, it is reasonable to assume that future physicians, as well as other health care professionals, will be not able to provide the highest quality care to patients in preventing and treating non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, the insufficient availability of physicians with specializations in nutrition has posed the basis for the development of non-medical careers in the field of nutrition. The present document was drafting by the Italian College of Academic Nutritionists, MED-49 (ICAN-49), with the aim to provide an overview on the nutritional competency standards covered by several health care professionals (Physicians Clinical Nutrition Specialists, Clinical Dietitians, Professional Clinical Nutrition Specialists, etc) for the prevention of diseases and/or support of pharmacological therapies. The aim of the ICAN 49 is to suggest a major shift in practice opportunities and roles for many nutritionists, especially for the management of the metabolic diseases, and promote a paradigm change: a clinical and educational leadership role for Physician Clinical Nutrition Specialists in the hospital setting.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medical and Surgical Science, University of Catanzaro Magna Grecia, Viale Europa, Catanzaro, 88100, Italy.

968,Certainty and intention in pregnancy decision-making: An exploratory study,"Objective: Abortion is often characterized as an inherently difficult decision, despite research demonstrating high decision certainty among abortion patients. Minimal research has examined decision certainty among people planning to continue a pregnancy. We examined whether women seeking abortion experience lower decision certainty than those planning to continue pregnancies and whether certainty differs by pregnancy intendedness. Study design: We administered the decisional conflict scale (DCS) to pregnant women (n = 149) at 8 U.S. primary and reproductive health clinics. Using Poisson regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and pregnancy characteristics, we evaluated differences in DCS scores (<25/100 vs ≥25/100) by pregnancy decision and whether pregnancy intention modified the effect of pregnancy decision on certainty. Results: Over one-half (58%) of respondents planned to have an abortion, 32% to continue the pregnancy, and 10% were unsure. DCS scores were low overall (median 9.4/100; IQR: 1.6, 25.0), indicative of high certainty, and the percentage scoring ≥25/100, reflecting any uncertainty, did not differ by pregnancy decision (23% abortion vs 19% continuing, p = 0.55). In a multivariable model, there was no statistically significant interaction between pregnancy decision (abortion vs continuing pregnancy) and intention. However, the predicted percentage reporting any uncertainty among respondents with intended pregnancies was comparable among those decided on abortion (13%) and continuing the pregnancy (16%). Among those with unintended pregnancies, these figures were 25% among those decided on abortion vs 36% among those continuing. Conclusion: Levels of certainty about a pregnancy decision were high and appeared to depend more on whether the pregnancy was intended or unintended than on the pregnancy decision itself. Implications: Similar levels of uncertainty among individuals who decided to have an abortion versus continue a pregnancy challenge the narrative that abortion is a particularly difficult medical and personal decision.

970,Multifetal Gestations and Associated Perinatal Risks,"Along with the rise of assisted reproductive technology, multifetal gestations increased dramatically. Twin pregnancies account for 97% of multifetal pregnancies and 3% of all births in the United States. Twins and higher-order multiples carry increased risks of obstetric, perinatal, and maternal complications; these risks increase with increasing fetal number. Neonatal morbidity and mortality in multifetal gestations is driven primarily by prematurity. Both spontaneous and indicated preterm births are increased in multifetal gestations, and only a limited number of strategies are available to mitigate this risk. No single intervention has been shown to decrease the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in most twin pregnancies. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is recommended in all multifetal pregnancies to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its associated complications. Antenatal management of multifetal gestations depends on chorionicity, which should be established using ultrasonography in the first trimester. Unlike dichorionic twin gestations, monochorionic pregnancies experience unique complications because of their shared vascular connections, and therefore, need frequent ultrasound surveillance. Even uncomplicated twin gestations have higher rates of unanticipated stillbirth compared with singletons. Delivery of twin pregnancies is generally indicated in the late preterm to early term period depending on chorionicity and other clinical factors. For most diamniotic twin pregnancies with a cephalic presenting fetus, vaginal delivery after 32 weeks' gestation is a safe and reasonable option with high rates of success and no increased risk of perinatal morbidity.","Affiliation 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.",Cassandra R Duffy ,Neoreviews,2021 Nov,"Review,Chorion,Delivery, Obstetric,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Twin,Premature Birth* / epidemiology,Premature Birth* / prevention & control",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34725138
971,Implementation of an Interprofessional Nutrition Workshop to Integrate Nutrition Education into a Preclinical Medical School Curriculum,"Objective: The patient-physician encounter provides an ideal opportunity to assess a patient's dietary history and its impact on total health. However, nutrition assessments and counseling in physician-patient encounters is often lacking. Insufficient nutrition education during medical school may lead to insecurity in assessing and counseling patients.Methods: Physicians and registered dietitians (RD) co-developed and co-facilitated a nutrition workshop for first-year medical students. Goals included increasing recognition of nutrition's impact on health and promoting student confidence and skills when attaining a nutrition history, assessing risk factors, and advising.Results: Seventy percent of students attested to having ""sufficient"" knowledge to counsel a patient on nutrition after the session compared to 38% before (Z= -4.46, p < 0.001). Sixty eight percent felt comfortable completing a nutritional assessment after the session compared to 35% before (Z= -4.30, p < 0.001). Sixty-three percent felt confident in advising patients about nutrition after the session compared to 32% before (Z= -4.20, p < 0.001). Students also significantly outperformed a control cohort on a nutrition-related component of an Objective Standardized Clinical Examination.Conclusions: Clinical nutrition education can be successfully integrated into the medical school curriculum as early as the first year. Interprofessional collaboration with RDs provided evidence-based content and authentic clinical experience in both the development of the workshop and in facilitating student discussion.","Affiliations 1 Departments of Science Education and Pediatrics, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA. 2 Departments of Science Education and Medicine, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA. 3 Department of Science Education, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA. 4 Department of Medicine, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA. 5 QA- Nutrition, Pediatrics/Adolescent Medicine, Northwell Health, Hempstead, New York, USA.","Marie Cavuoto Petrizzo , Lauren Block , Doreen M Olvet , Eva M Sheridan , Rebecca Dougherty , Matthew Whitson , Janice T John , Maria-Louise Barilla-LaBarca , Stephanie DiFiglia-Peck , Alice Fornari ",J Am Coll Nutr,2021 Feb,"Counseling,Curriculum,Humans,Nutritional Sciences*,Schools, Medical,Students, Medical*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32223644
972,Dreaming of the sleep lab,"The phenomenon of dreaming about the laboratory when participating in a sleep study is common. The content of such dreams draws upon episodic memory fragments of the participant's lab experience, generally, experimenters, electrodes, the lab setting, and experimental tasks. However, as common as such dreams are, they have rarely been given a thorough quantitative or qualitative treatment. Here we assessed 528 dreams (N = 343 participants) collected in a Montreal sleep lab to 1) evaluate state and trait factors related to such dreams, and 2) investigate the phenomenology of lab incorporations using a new scoring system. Lab incorporations occurred in over a third (35.8%) of all dreams and were especially likely to occur in REM sleep (44.2%) or from morning naps (48.4%). They tended to be related to higher depression scores, but not to sex, nightmare-proneness or anxiety. Common themes associated with lab incorporation were: Meta-dreaming, including lucid dreams and false awakenings (40.7%), Sensory incorporations (27%), Wayfinding to, from or within the lab (24.3%), Sleep as performance (19.6%), Friends/Family in the lab (15.9%) and Being an object of observation (12.2%). Finally, 31.7% of the lab incorporation dreams included relative projections into a near future (e.g., the experiment having been completed), but very few projections into the past (2.6%). Results clarify sleep stage and sleep timing factors associated with dreamed lab incorporations. Phenomenological findings further reveal both the typical and unique ways in which lab memory elements are incorporated de novo into dreaming. Identified themes point to frequent social and skillful dream scenarios that entail monitoring of one's current state (in the lab) and projection of the self into dream environments elaborated around local space and time. The findings have implications for understanding fundamental dream formation mechanisms but also for appreciating both the advantages and methodological pitfalls of conducting laboratory-based dream collection.","Affiliations 1 Dream & Nightmare Laboratory, Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, CIUSSS-NÎM - Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Montréal, Canada. 2 Department of Neuroscience, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada. 3 Department of Psychiatry and Addictology, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada. 4 Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.","Claudia Picard-Deland , Tore Nielsen , Michelle Carr ",PLoS One,2021 Oct 6,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Dreams / physiology*,Female,Humans,Laboratories,Male,Memory, Episodic,Mental Recall / physiology,Polysomnography,Sleep / physiology*,Sleep Stages / physiology*,Sleep, REM / physiology*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34614021
973,How REM sleep shapes hypothalamic computations for feeding behavior,"The electrical activity of diverse brain cells is modulated across states of vigilance, namely wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Enhanced activity of neuronal circuits during NREM sleep impacts on subsequent awake behaviors, yet the significance of their activation, or lack thereof, during REM sleep remains unclear. This review focuses on feeding-promoting cells in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that express the vesicular GABA and glycine transporter (vgat) as a model to further understand the impact of REM sleep on neural encoding of goal-directed behavior. It emphasizes both spatial and temporal aspects of hypothalamic cell dynamics across awake behaviors and REM sleep, and discusses a role for REM sleep in brain plasticity underlying energy homeostasis and behavioral optimization.","Affiliations 1 Zentrum für Experimentelle Neurologie, Department of Neurology, Inselspital University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of Biomedical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of Neurobiology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. 2 Zentrum für Experimentelle Neurologie, Department of Neurology, Inselspital University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland; Department of Biomedical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

977,Chinese herbal medicine: Fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection on all fronts,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly pathogenic virus that has spread rapidly across the entire world. There is a critical need to develop safe and effective drugs, especially broad-spectrum antiviral and organ protection agents in order to treat and prevent this dangerous disease. It is possible that Chinese herbal medicine may play an essential role in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aim of the review: We aim to review the use of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19 both in vitro and in clinical practice. Our goal was to provide a better understanding of the potential therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicine and to establish a ""Chinese protocol"" for the treatment of COVID-19. Materials and methods: We systematically reviewed published research relating to traditional Chinese herbal medicines and the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 from inception to the 6th January 2021 by screening a range of digital databases (Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, X-MOL, Wanfang Data, Google Scholar, PubMed, Elsevier, and other resources) and public platforms relating to the management of clinical trials. We included the active ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines, monomer preparations, crude extracts, and formulas for the treatment of COVID-19. Results: In mainland China, a range of Chinese herbal medicines have been recognized as very promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, including active ingredients (quercetagetin, osajin, tetrandrine, proscillaridin A, and dihydromyricetin), monomer preparations (xiyanping injection, matrine-sodium chloride injection, diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsules, and sodium aescinate injection), crude extracts (Scutellariae Radix extract and garlic essential oil), and formulas (Qingfei Paidu decoction, Lianhuaqingwen capsules, and Pudilan Xiaoyan oral liquid). All these agents have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and have attracted significant attention due to their activities both in vitro and in clinical practice. Conclusions: As a key component of the COVID-19 treatment regimen, Chinese herbal medicines have played an irreplaceable role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ""Chinese protocol"" has already demonstrated clear clinical importance. The use of Chinese herbal medicines that are capable of inhibiting SARS-Cov-2 infection may help to address this immediate unmet clinical need and may be attractive to other countries that are also seeking new options for effective COVID-19 treatment. Our analyses suggest that countries outside of China should also consider protocols involving Chinese herbal medicines combat this fast-spreading viral infection.","Affiliations 1 Key Laboratory of Green Natural Products and Pharmaceutical Intermediates in Colleges and Universities of Shandong Province, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Qufu Normal University, Qufu, 273165, PR China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, PR China.

979,Maternal prenatal stress and its effects on primary pregnancy outcomes in twin pregnancies,"Objective: To assess the prevalence and degrees of maternal prenatal stress among twin-pregnant women and to investigate the impact of prenatal stress on primary pregnancy outcomes.Methods: The Chongqing Longitudinal Twin Study (LoTiS) began in December 2015 in China. Participants of LoTiS who met the inclusion criteria were recruited into this study and completed a stress rating scale (PSRS) in both early and late pregnancy. Maternal prenatal stress was examined in subgroups. Correlations between maternal prenatal stress and primary pregnancy outcomes were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.Results: A total of 215 eligible twin pregnancies from LoTiS were recruited into this study. The overall mean scores of prenatal stress were 43.41 ± 19.84 and 51.33 ± 20.43 in early and late pregnancy, respectively. The first prenatal stressor was regarding concern about the pregnancy and childbirth safety. Subgroup analyses revealed prenatal stress in late pregnancy that differed based on different pregravid BMIs and education levels. Correlation analysis suggested that the risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes increases 1.8% per unit of stress scale in late pregnancy (OR = 1.018, 95% CI 1.001-1.025).Conclusions: Prenatal stress in twin pregnancies increases with the progression of pregnancy. Higher stress in late pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of premature rupture of membranes; therefore, interventions might be essential for improving pregnancy outcomes.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. 2 The Joint International Research Laboratory of Reproduction & Development, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. 3 State Key Laboratory of Maternal and Fetal Medicine of Chongqing Municipality, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. 4 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First People's Hospital of Yuhang District, Hangzhou, China. 5 Department of Obstetrics, Chongqing Women and Children's Health Center, Chongqing, China. 6 Cancer, Disease and Developmental Epigenetics, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, and Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia. 7 College of Life Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.","Wenling Wang , Li Wen , Yan Zhang , Lan Wang , Longqiong Wang , Zhi Chen , Lan Zhang , Chen Zhang , Jie Li , Chao Tong , Hongbo Qi , Richard Saffery , Philip N Baker ",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,2020 Sep,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Twin Study,Adult,China / epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Female,Fetal Membranes, Premature Rupture / psychology,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Outcome / psychology*,Pregnancy, Twin / psychology*,Psychometrics / instrumentation,Stress, Psychological / epidemiology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31066336
980,Twin chorionicity-specific population birth-weight charts adjusted for estimated fetal weight,"Objectives: To construct chorionicity-specific birth-weight reference charts for dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) and monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies, incorporating estimated-fetal-weight (EFW) data in order to adjust for the relationship between suboptimal growth and preterm delivery. An additional aim was to determine if the inclusion of complicated twin pregnancies impacts on the reference charts produced. Methods: The inclusion criteria for this retrospective cohort study were twin pregnancy of known DCDA or MCDA chorionicity, known pregnancy outcome, last ultrasound scan within 14 days before birth and delivery between 25 and 38 weeks' gestation (Analysis A). An analysis was also conducted excluding pregnancies with complications recorded (Analysis B). Previously published twin EFW reference ranges were used in the analysis. A joint statistical model for EFW and observed birth weight for each pregnancy was created in order to estimate population birth-weight reference ranges corresponding to the distribution expected if all pregnancies delivered at any given gestational age. It was not assumed that the median EFW was equal to birth weight for any given gestational age. The models were fitted using a Bayesian approach. Results: We retrieved data on 1664 twin pregnancies, of which 707 DCDA and 241 MCDA pregnancies met the inclusion criteria. In Analysis A, the estimated population median birth weight was similar to the median EFW at around 27 weeks' gestation but fell below the EFW values with increasing gestation, being 156 g lower in both DCDA and MCDA pregnancies at 35 weeks; this finding was confirmed by direct comparison of the last EFW and birth-weight values in each pregnancy. When the analysis was repeated after excluding complicated twin pregnancies (Analysis B), compared with Analysis A, there was very little difference in the median birth-weight results obtained across gestation. The largest absolute difference between Analyses A and B for DCDA twins was at 31, 32 and 33 weeks, with a 9-g lower median birth weight in Analysis A compared with Analysis B. The largest absolute difference for MCDA twins was greater than that for DCDA twins, with a 21-g lower median birth weight at 25 weeks in Analysis A compared with Analysis B. Conclusions: We have established population chorionicity-specific birth-weight reference charts for DCDA and MCDA twin pregnancies, corresponding to the range expected were all pregnancies to deliver at any given gestational age. In this population of twins, the median birth weight was consistently lower than that reported for singletons, and there was variation in the median birth weight at different gestational ages according to chorionicity. © 2021 The Authors.

981,Challenges in the quality of herbal medicinal products with a specific focus on contaminants,"Background: The complex regulatory framework for the quality of herbal medicinal products, in particular with regard to potential contaminants, consists of legal provisions including Pharmacopoeia requirements, relating to limits as well as in most cases to methods for determination. Objective: This review intends to provide an overview on the legal requirements for testing potential contaminants in herbal drugs used for the production of herbal medicinal products. Methodology: The following issues are described and discussed: For the assessment of pesticide residues, Chapter 2.8.13 of the European Pharmacopoeia and Regulation (EC) 396/2005 applies, for heavy metals the general Pharmacopoeia monograph as well as the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Q3D guideline on elemental impurities. The Pharmacopoeia also includes limits and acceptance criteria for microbiological purity and aflatoxins, respectively. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are mentioned in Regulation (EC) 1881/2006 for food as well as in a Reflection Paper on herbal medicinal products. For several years, a potential contamination with pyrrolizidine alkaloids was discussed which led to measures being imposed on industry and health authorities. Results: Various examples demonstrate that the evaluation of data from daily analytical practice is extremely useful to gain an overview on the occurrence of residues and/or contaminants in herbal drugs and herbal preparations. Such evaluations might assist manufacturers in their individual risk assessment and the definition of their testing strategies and contribute to guarantee the quality and safety of the marketed products. Conclusion: Annual data evaluations demonstrate that a remarkable decrease of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid content burden in herbal drugs and extracts used for the production of herbal medicinal products has been achieved over the past few years. However, it has also become clear that this issue cannot be completely solved in the near future.","Affiliation 1 Department Herbal and Homoeopathic Medicinal Products, Bundesverband der Arzneimittel-Hersteller e.V.

982,Twin pregnancy in which both fetuses have Cantrell's pentalogy: A case report and literature review,"Cantrell's pentalogy is a congenital multiple malformation consisting of midline supraumbilical thoraco-abdominal wall defects, anterior and pericardial diaphragm defects, lower sternum defects, ectopia cordis and various intracardiac anomalies. Complete pentalogy is very rare. Some additional anomalies may accompany pentalogy and there are cases in the literature where chromosomal anomalies and pentalogy are seen. Cases of Cantrell's pentalogy in twin pregnancies are rare. Twin pregnancies with Cantrell's pentalogy in both fetuses are one of the rarest cases in the literature. In this study, we presented a twin pregnancy case with Cantrell's pentalogy in both fetuses and we reviewed twin pregnancy cases in which Cantrell's pentalogy was seen in the literature. In our case, anomalies were found in both fetuses in the evaluation performed on a 32-year-old, gravida 2, para 1 woman with 10 weeks + 5 days monochorionic-monoamniotic twin pregnancy. The first fetus had ectopia cordis, cystic hygroma and increased nuchal thickness (4.6 mm), and the anterior abdominal wall was in contact with the amniotic band. The second fetus had ectopia cordis omphalocele, cystic hygroma, holoprosencephaly and a single lower extremity deficiency. Both fetuses were pre-diagnosed with Cantrell's pentalogy and the parents were informed about the adverse course of the fetuses. After the completion of the legal procedures, with the approval and decision of the parents, termination was made in the 11th week of pregnancy. External images of the fetuses confirmed the diagnosis. The family denied the autopsy procedure. When we review the literature, twin pregnancies complicated by Cantrell's pentalogy are divided into 3 groups: Group1- cases where one of the twins has completely normal phenotype and the other twin has Cantrell's pentalogy; Group2- cases where one of the twins has Cantrell's pentalogy and the other twin does not have the Cantrell's pentalogy but has several anomalies; Group3- cases where both fetuses have Cantrell's pentalogy. In conclusion, early diagnosis of twin pregnancy cases complicated by Cantrell's pentalogy and determination of all anomalies in both fetuses are very important in terms of obstetric management.","Affiliations 1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Erzin State Hospital, Hatay, Turkey.

984,Unintended pregnancy and viral suppression in pregnant women living with HIV,"Background: Approximately half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended; the likelihood of unintended pregnancy may be even higher for women living with HIV. Women with unintended pregnancies often have worse obstetrical outcomes than women who planned their pregnancies, although the relationship of unintended pregnancy to outcomes among women living with HIV in the United States is unknown. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether pregnancy intendedness among women living with HIV attending a specialty obstetrical clinic was associated with achievement of maternal viral suppression by delivery, a key component of preventing perinatal transmission of HIV. Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women living with HIV who received prenatal care and had a live-born infant at a single tertiary center (2007-2014). Women were asked as part of routine clinical care whether they intended their current pregnancy. Women who expressed at their initial obstetrician visit that their pregnancy was mistimed or undesired were determined to have an unintended pregnancy. Women were considered virally suppressed when the HIV RNA viral load was <20 copies/mL. We examined whether pregnancy intendedness was associated with whether the viral load was undetectable at the time of delivery. We also determined whether women with unintended pregnancies were less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy at the time of entry to prenatal care. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and chi-square tests were used for bivariable analyses, and logistic and linear regression were used for multivariable analyses. Results: Of the 215 women who met inclusion criteria, 201 (93.5%) had complete data on pregnancy intendedness. Of these 201 women, 137 (68.2%) had an unintended pregnancy. Unintended pregnancy was associated with lower odds of viral suppression at delivery (95.3% of women with planned pregnancies were virally suppressed at delivery compared with 76.6% of women with unplanned pregnancies; adjusted odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.89, after adjusting for potential confounders). In this study, 48.9% of women with unintended pregnancies presented later in pregnancy for prenatal care (after the first trimester) compared with 21.9% of women with intended pregnancies (P<.001). Women with unintended pregnancies were also less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy before entry to prenatal care (20.4% of women with unintended pregnancies vs 50.0% of women with intended pregnancies; adjusted odds ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.81; P<.001). Conclusion: Among pregnant women living with HIV, women with an unintended pregnancy were less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy before initiating prenatal care and were less likely to be virally suppressed at the time of delivery.","Affiliations 1 Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.

985,Pregnancy outcome in women with different rheumatic diseases: a retrospective analysis,"Objective: Pregnancy may influence the course of inflammatory rheumatic diseases and, conversely, rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) can affect the outcome of pregnancy. This study aimed to retrospectively analyse the outcome of pregnancy and disease in women with RMDs.Method: Subjects were patients with high-risk pregnancy and connective tissue diseases (CTDs) or inflammatory joint diseases (IJDs) managed at a specialized rheumatology outpatient clinic from 2007 to 2014. Data from conception to 6 months postpartum were collected from medical records and a questionnaire, and analysed regarding clinical symptoms, medications, pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and infant development. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare the groups (CTD vs IJD).Results: The eligible 66 pregnancies in 57 RMD patients were divided into two groups by RMD type: CTD (n = 48) or IJD (n = 18). The live birth rate was 97% overall. Pregnancy complications (excluding two twin pregnancies) were incurred in 39.1%: miscarriage (n = 2), premature delivery (n = 12), small-for-gestational-age infants (n = 5), and/or pregnancy-related diseases (n = 14). Three children born to women with CTDs had affected development (autism spectrum disorder, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia). CTD infants had a significantly lower mean gestational age (in weeks) (p = 0.042), weight (p = 0.009), and length (p = 0.016) at birth than IJD infants.Conclusion: Although the live birth rate was high, complications occurred in 39.1% of pregnancies in this cohort. Therefore, interdisciplinary management of pregnant women with RMDs at specialized clinics is strongly recommended.","Affiliations 1 Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charité University Hospital, Berlin, Germany. 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Parkklinik Weißensee, Berlin, Germany.","H Eisfeld , A M Glimm , G R Burmester , S Ohrndorf , M Backhaus ",Scand J Rheumatol,2021 Jul,"Adolescent,Adult,Connective Tissue Diseases / complications*,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Live Birth,Male,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications*,Pregnancy Outcome,Premature Birth / etiology*,Rheumatic Diseases / complications*,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622159
986,A Review of Unintended Pregnancy in Opioid-Using Women: Implications for Nursing,"Background: Opioid use among reproductive-age women has greatly increased, resulting in high rates of opioid-exposed pregnancies, which are associated with negative outcomes, such as neonatal abstinence syndrome. Prevention of unintended pregnancy among opioid users is a critical pathway to reducing opioid-exposed pregnancies; however, little is known about pregnancy intention in this group. This article estimates the prevalence of unintended pregnancy among opioid-using women, thereby supporting efforts to develop interventions to reduce unintended pregnancy. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses framework. Reference lists of articles were searched. Eligibility criteria included reported unintended pregnancy rates within a population of opioid-using women of reproductive age. The search was completed in July 2018 and updated in October 2019. Results: We identified 115 citations, screened 64 titles/abstracts, reviewed 31 full-text articles, and included 12 articles for this review. Rates of unintended pregnancy in opioid users were estimated in two ways, across the lifetime and for a current pregnancy, depending on study samples. Rates for both groups were high, with rates among currently pregnant opioid-using women (85%) compared with 45% among the general population. Conclusions and implications: Unintended pregnancy rates in opioid-using women were strikingly high, indicating a critical need for intervention. Routine inclusion of pregnancy planning in opioid treatment care is indicated. Education regarding contraception and opioid treatment services is essential for nurses in these settings. Family planning and opioid treatment efforts can be optimized by care coordination, with focus on nurse training for screening and patient education.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Samantha L Auerbach, Kafuli Agbemenu, Gretchen E Ely, Rebecca Lorenz",J Addict Nurs,2021 Apr-Jun,"Systematic Review,Analgesics, Opioid*,Contraception,Family Planning Services,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome*,Nursing Care,Pregnancy,Pregnancy, Unplanned*,Analgesics, Opioid",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34060761
987,Eye anomalies in children born through ART,"Due to the increasing rate of couples suffering from infertility, recently, the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has increased by 5%-10% per year. Some ART pregnancies are at risk of obstetric and neonatal complications, but it is unknown whether the procedures used or the etiology of infertility influences this risk. Multiple ART pregnancies are responsible for the increased rate of prematurity and its associated complications. Also, it has been demonstrated that ART pregnancies have a higher risk of congenital anomalies. The rate of ART-associated ocular abnormalities is incompletely known due to a small number of studies conducted regarding this pathology. In this paper, we presented a review of literature on ocular anomalies associated with ART in order to raise awareness of the need to implement ophthalmological screening in children from pregnancies obtained by ART.

988,Prepregnancy counseling in women over 50 years of age,"Over the past decade, there has been a steep rise in the proportion of women who become pregnant at an advanced maternal age. Personal goals and cultural changes along with the advancement in artificial reproductive therapies have enabled women who wish to defer childbearing when given an opportunity to do so, and pregnancy rates in this age group are not likely to decrease. However, accumulating evidence suggests that pregnancies at an advanced maternal age are associated with an increased risk for maternal and neonatal complications. This review provides an evidence-based view of advanced maternal age pregnancy and focuses on prepregnancy counseling to optimize women's health prior to conception.","Affiliations 1 Lis Maternity Hospital, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Israel. 2 Lis Maternity Hospital, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Israel.

989,Number of Pregnancies and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation,"Pregnancy is associated with major structural and hemodynamic changes in the cardiovascular system that predispose women to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. While these changes generally resolve after parturition, the impact of subsequent pregnancies on the risk of atrial fibrillation is unknown. We searched through PubMed for studies that have investigated the impact of multiparity on the risk of atrial fibrillation. The following Medical Subject Headings terms were used: ([repeated pregnancies] OR parity) AND ([Atrial fibrillation] OR AF). Studies with complete data were included in the current study. Out of 135 studies identified through the prespecified criteria, we selected 2 studies with relevant data. Increasing number of pregnancies was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in a dose-response relationship. Our systematic review suggests that multiparity is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. More studies are warranted to elucidate the association between repeated pregnancies and atrial fibrillation.","Affiliations 1 Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38136.

990,The complex relationship between contraception and abortion,"The incidence of abortion is determined by the incidence of unwelcome, or unintended, pregnancies and the propensity to terminate rather than take them to term. Exposure to the risk of unintended pregnancy rises as the desired family sizes fall, because fewer years of reproductive life are taken up with desired pregnancies. Increases in contraceptive use over recent decades have reduced the risk of unintended pregnancies, but this effect has been moderated in many regions of the world by increased propensity to terminate such pregnancies. Globally, a large majority of abortions are still the direct consequence of non-use of any contraceptive precautions among women or couples not wishing to conceive. Reasons for non-use vary but side effects and health concerns figure prominently. As overall contraceptive use increases, choice of methods becomes a more important influence on the likelihood of unintended pregnancies and abortions. Sterilization, implants and IUDs are more effective at pregnancy-prevention than methods requiring skill, discipline, memory and frequent re-supply. Effective promotion of these methods, however, is difficult once other methods have become entrenched.","Affiliation 1 Faculty of Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK.

991,[Clinical characteristics and outcome of pregnant patients with myasthenia gravis],"Objective: To study the clinical characteristics of pregnant patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and the influence of MG to pregnancy. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted including 28 MG patients with 38 pregnancies admitted to the 8th Medical Center of PLA General Hospital between January 2013 and October 2018. Data were collected including clinical scores of MG, serum level of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and history of thymectomy before pregnancy. The course of pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcome were also analyzed. According the outcome of MG, patients were divided into three groups, i.e. improvement group, stable group and deterioration group. Results: (1) The age of MG patients ranged from 21 to 36 (27±4) years. The previous course of MG was 0.5-17.2 (7.4±5.8)years. Based on Osserman clinical type, type ⅡA was the most common one [44.1% (15/34)], followed with type Ⅰ [29.4% (10/34)], type ⅡB [23.5% (8/34)] and type Ⅳ (2.9%).(2)There were 38 pregnancies in 28 women whose pregnancy outcomes resulted in one spontaneous abortion, three embryonic arrest and 34 live births. All abortions developed in the first trimester. Among the 34 pregnancies with live births, the symptoms of MG improved in 16 pregnancies (47.1%), whereas those deteriorated in 10 pregnancies (29.4%) during the first or third trimester and remained stable in 8 pregnancies (23.5%). (3) Compared with improvement group and stable group, the deterioration group had shorter duration of MG [(1.1±0.5) years vs. (7.1±5.1) years, (9.0±5.4) years respectively], higher clinical scores (20.9±6.0 vs. 14.8±6.6,13.3±5.0) and more frequent abnormal RNS(9/10 vs. 8/16, 4/8) and type ⅡB(6/10 vs. 1/16, 1/8) before pregnancy. Positive rate of serum AChR antibody and percentage of thymectomy before pregnancy were comparable between three groups. (4) Spinal anesthesia was performed in 23 pregnancies and 11 cases were vaginal delivery. No transient neonatal MG were found in live-born infants. Conclusions: Pregnancy in patients with under-controlled myasthenia gravis should not be discouraged. The outcome of MG is affected by the duration of MG, MG score and RNS before pregnancy. The first and third trimesters of pregnancy are considered high-risk periods for MG exacerbations. Neonatal transient myasthenia is uncommon, but the newborn should be carefully monitored by obstetricians and neurologists.","Affiliations 1 Department of Neurology, the First Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853,China. 2 Department of Aspiration and Critical Care, the Eighth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100091,China. 3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Seventh Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100091,China.","Y P Chen , J Zhang , B Chen , W Wang , M Fan , X Y Tao ",Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,2021 Feb 1,"Adult,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Myasthenia Gravis*,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications*,Pregnancy Outcome,Retrospective Studies,Thymectomy,Young Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33503721

995,Pregnancy after pancreas-kidney transplantation,"A combined kidney and pancreas transplant is a therapeutic option for patients with type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease. After successful transplantation, fertility is rapidly restored, allowing women of childbearing age to have spontaneous pregnancies and men to father pregnancies. These pregnancies are at increased risk for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes due to immunosuppressive therapy, comorbidities, previous type 1 diabetes and previous transplant surgery, although the majority ends with the birth of a live and healthy offspring. Hypertension, miscarriages, diabetes, infections, graft rejections, preterm delivery and low birth weight may complicate pregnancies after pancreas-kidney transplantation. Since not all immunosuppressive drugs can be safely used in pregnancy, it is important to review immunosuppressive treatment before conception. Adequate pre-conception counseling is important to inform women and their partners about potential risks for the pregnancy and the grafts and the advantages of pregnancy planning. These pregnancies should be managed within a multidisciplinary team, comprising a transplant physician, an endocrinologist, a nephrologist, an obstetrician and a neonatologist. Last but not least, it is very important to continue collecting data on the pregnancies in pancreas-kidney transplantation with the aim to improve knowledge and to generate evidence-based guidelines for the care of women after pancreas-kidney transplants who are considering a pregnancy.","Affiliations 1 Department of Internal Medicine, Diabetes and Metabolism, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy. 2 Diabetes Research Institute, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. 3 Clinical Transplant Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. 4 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. 5 Department of Internal Medicine, Diabetes and Metabolism, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milan, Italy. scavini.marina@hsr.it. 6 Diabetes Research Institute, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. scavini.marina@hsr.it. 7 Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.","Amelia Caretto , Rossana Caldara , Maria Teresa Castiglioni , Marina Scavini , Antonio Secchi ",J Nephrol,2020 Oct,"Review,Female,Humans,Immunosuppressive Agents / adverse effects,Kidney,Kidney Transplantation* / adverse effects,Male,Pancreas,Pancreas Transplantation* / adverse effects,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications* / etiology,Pregnancy Outcome,Immunosuppressive Agents",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32959341
996,Detailed Assessment of Sleep Architecture With Deep Learning and Shorter Epoch-to-Epoch Duration Reveals Sleep Fragmentation of Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Traditional sleep staging with non-overlapping 30-second epochs overlooks multiple sleep-wake transitions. We aimed to overcome this by analyzing the sleep architecture in more detail with deep learning methods and hypothesized that the traditional sleep staging underestimates the sleep fragmentation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. To test this hypothesis, we applied deep learning-based sleep staging to identify sleep stages with the traditional approach and by using overlapping 30-second epochs with 15-, 5-, 1-, or 0.5-second epoch-to-epoch duration. A dataset of 446 patients referred for polysomnography due to OSA suspicion was used to assess differences in the sleep architecture between OSA severity groups. The amount of wakefulness increased while REM and N3 decreased in severe OSA with shorter epoch-to-epoch duration. In other OSA severity groups, the amount of wake and N1 decreased while N3 increased. With the traditional 30-second epoch-to-epoch duration, only small differences in sleep continuity were observed between the OSA severity groups. With 1-second epoch-to-epoch duration, the hazard ratio illustrating the risk of fragmented sleep was 1.14 (p = 0.39) for mild OSA, 1.59 (p < 0.01) for moderate OSA, and 4.13 (p < 0.01) for severe OSA. With shorter epoch-to-epoch durations, total sleep time and sleep efficiency increased in the non-OSA group and decreased in severe OSA. In conclusion, more detailed sleep analysis emphasizes the highly fragmented sleep architecture in severe OSA patients which can be underestimated with traditional sleep staging. The results highlight the need for a more detailed analysis of sleep architecture when assessing sleep disorders.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Henri Korkalainen, Timo Leppanen, Brett Duce, Samu Kainulainen, Juhani Aakko, Akseli Leino, Laura Kalevo, Isaac O Afara, Sami Myllymaa, Juha Toyras",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,2021 Jul,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Deep Learning*,Humans,Polysomnography,Sleep,Sleep Apnea, Obstructive* / diagnosis,Sleep Deprivation,Sleep Stages",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33296317
997,Recreational beach tennis reduces 24-h blood pressure in adults with hypertension: a randomized crossover trial,"Purpose: To evaluate the effect of a beach tennis session on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in adults with hypertension. Methods: In this randomized crossover trial, 24 participants (12 men and 12 women) randomly performed two experimental sessions: a beach tennis session and a non-exercise control session. The beach tennis session started with a standardized 5-min warm-up consisting of basic techniques, followed by three 12-min beach tennis matches with 2-min intervals between them. Heart rate was continuously recorded and rating of perceived exertion was assessed in the middle and at the end of each set during the beach tennis session. Enjoyment was also assessed after the beach tennis session. The control session was performed in seated rest. Both experimental sessions lasted 45 min. Ambulatory blood pressure was measured continuously for 24 h after sessions. Results: Systolic blood pressure (24-h: 6 mmHg, P = 0.008; daytime: 6 mmHg, P = 0.031; nighttime: 6 mmHg, P = 0.042) and diastolic blood pressure (24-h: 3 mmHg, P = 0.021; daytime: 3 mmHg, P = 0.036; nighttime: 4 mmHg, P = 0.076) decreased after beach tennis when compared with control. The participants presented a reserve heart rate of 59-68%, and a rating of perceived exertion score of 3.4-4.7 using Borg's CR10 Scale. The enjoyment scores after beach tennis session were higher than 90%. Conclusion: A single session of recreational beach tennis reduces 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in adults with hypertension. Additionally, the participants can achieve a high physiological stress but perceive less effort during the practice.

1003,Preview long hair follicular unit excision: An up-and-coming technique,"Background: Follicular unit excision (FUE) is a popular hair transplant technique, but requires shaving the donor area. This is a deterrent for some patients wishing to keep their hair transplant discreet. The new long hair FUE technique avoids shaving the donor area, which appeals to a wider patient population; however, it has a reputation of being technically challenging and slow. Aims: We review the tools and techniques developed for long hair FUE and present our experience using the Trivellini Long Hair System and Long Hair punch. Discussion: With the new advances in tools and techniques for long hair FUE, this method is gaining momentum and has the potential to be the next trend in the hair transplant industry. There are a few different punch designs marketed specifically for long hair FUE (window/slotted, Trivellini Long Hair, and bi-pronged). Although this technique is slower to perform than shaven FUE, graft survival and final outcome are comparable. Conclusions: Innovations in technology have made the long hair FUE technique more accessible to hair transplant surgeons. It is important for hair restoration surgeons to keep knowledgeable about this technique in order to maintain a competitive business.","Affiliations 1 Trivellini Hair Restoration, Asunciόn, Paraguay. 2 Perez Meza Hair Institute, Benalmádena, Málaga, Spain. 3 Mediprobe Research Inc, London, ON, Canada. 4 Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto School of Medicine, Toronto, ON, Canada.","Roberto Trivellini , David Perez-Meza , Helen J Renaud , Aditya K Gupta ",J Cosmet Dermatol,2021 Nov,"Review,Alopecia / surgery,Hair,Hair Follicle*,Humans,Skin Transplantation,Surgeons*,Tissue and Organ Harvesting",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33629463/

1006,Breast Implants: Common Questions and Answers,"Breast implants are used for a wide range of cosmetic and reconstructive purposes. In addition to breast augmentation, implants can be used for postmastectomy breast reconstruction, correction of congenital breast anomalies, breast or chest wall deformities, and male-to-female top surgery. Breast implants may confer significant benefits to patients, but several factors are important to consider preoperatively, including the impact on mammography, future lactation, and potential long-term implant complications (e.g., infection, capsular contracture, rupture, and the need for revision, replacement, or removal). A fundamental understanding of implant monitoring is also paramount to implant use. Patients with silicone breast implants should undergo routine screening for implant rupture with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography completed five to six years postoperatively and then every two to three years thereafter. With the exception of complications, there are no formal recommendations regarding the timing of breast implant removal or exchange. Women with unilateral breast swelling should be evaluated with ultrasonography for an effusion that might indicate breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. There are no specific breast cancer screening recommendations for patients with breast implants, but special mammographic views are indicated to enhance accuracy. Although these discussions are a routine component of consultation and postoperative follow-up for plastic surgeons performing these procedures, family physicians should have a working knowledge of implant indications, characteristics, and complications to better counsel their patients, to ensure appropriate screening, and to coordinate care after surgery.","Affiliation 1 University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.","Sarina Schrager , Sarah M Lyon , Samuel O Poore ",Am Fam Physician,2021 Nov 1,"Aftercare / methods,Breast Implantation* / adverse effects,Breast Implantation* / instrumentation,Breast Implantation* / methods,Breast Implants* / adverse effects,Breast Implants* / classification,Breast* / diagnostic imaging,Breast* / surgery,Female,Humans,Long Term Adverse Effects* / diagnosis,Long Term Adverse Effects* / etiology,Long Term Adverse Effects* / prevention & control,Male,Mammography / methods,Mastectomy / adverse effects*,Postoperative Complications / diagnosis*,Postoperative Complications / etiology,Postoperative Complications / prevention & control,Reconstructive Surgical Procedures / methods,Sex Reassignment Surgery / methods,Surgery, Plastic / methods",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34783490/
1007,Breast implants. A review,"Breast implants have been used for about four decades for both reconstructive and aesthetic purposes. In 1963, the quality of the artificial implants was revolutionized by the introduction of the silicone gel-filled implant. Since, this modern prosthesis has gone through an evolution of change and improvement with several types of devices with many variations and styles within each class. Actually, for the last three decades, approximately one million women have received silicone breast implants in the USA. But, in 1992, the American FDA banned silicone from the market, leaving saline implants as the only product generally available as an alternative until now. Other filler materials were introduced, but have never progressed beyond the experimental stage in the USA (in contrast with Europe). The evolution of the different implants through time, with their advantages and disadvantages will be discussed, but also the controversy on silicone implants in the USA and their suspected association with systemic diseases.","Affiliation 1 Department of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic surgery, Surgery of the hand and Burncenter, University Hospital Sart Tilman, Liège, Belgium.","D Van Zele , O Heymans",Acta Chir Belg,2004 Apr,"Historical Article,Review,Autoimmune Diseases / etiology,Breast Implantation / history*,Breast Implantation / instrumentation,Breast Implants / adverse effects,Breast Implants / history*,Connective Tissue Diseases / etiology,Device Approval,Female,History, 20th Century,History, 21st Century,Humans,Silicone Gels / adverse effects,United States,United States Food and Drug Administration,Silicone Gels",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15154572/
1008,Adverse Effects and Imaging Appearances of Breast Implants,"Implants commonly are used to augment or reconstruct breasts but are associated with many adverse effects, both in the short term and years after implantation. This article discusses different types of breast implants and some of the common adverse effects associated with them including contracture, rupture, leakage, and infection. The clinical and imaging appearances of these adverse effects are presented. In addition, the article describes findings and recommendations regarding rare breast implant-associated adverse effects such as anaplastic large cell lymphoma and breast fibromatosis.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,Kathryn Faguy,Radiol Technol,2018 May,"Review,Breast Implantation / adverse effects*,Breast Implants / adverse effects*,Device Removal,Diagnostic Imaging*,Female,Humans",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29793920/
1009,"Breast implants and breast cancer: a review of incidence, detection, mortality, and survival","Soon after breast implants were commercially introduced over 30 years ago, questions about potential carcinogenicity were raised. Animal experiments dating back to the mid-twentieth century demonstrated that foreign body implantation of many materials, including silicone, can induce sarcomas. Indeed, female breast cancer incidence rates in the United States have increased substantially over that period. Of the several published studies from various countries that have formally investigated the risk of breast cancer among augmentation mammaplasty patients, none show any evidence of increased risk. In fact, most find lower than expected risk, some with statistically significant reductions. Similarly, breast cancer mortality among these patients is generally found to be below that expected of other similar women. Delayed detection of breast cancer is a concern for these patients because implants can interfere with mammography. However, using indicators such as stage at diagnosis and tumor size, current research shows that augmentation patients do not experience delayed detection. Furthermore, several comparisons of post-breast cancer survival of augmented versus nonaugmented patients have found no significant differences. In summary, breast implants are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer incidence or death, and these patients do not experience delayed detection or poorer post-breast cancer survival.","Affiliation 1 Los Angeles, Calif.

1010,Infection in breast implants,"Infection is the leading cause of morbidity that occurs after breast implantation and complicates 2.0-2.5% of interventions in most case series. Two-thirds of infections develop within the acute post-operative period, whereas some infections may develop years or even decades after surgery. Infection rates are higher after breast reconstruction and subsequent implantation than after breast augmentation. Risk factors for infection associated with breast implantation have not been carefully assessed in prospective studies with long-term follow-up. Surgical technique and the patient's underlying condition are the most important determinants. In particular, breast reconstruction after mastectomy and radiotherapy for cancer is associated with a higher risk for infection. The origin of infection in women with implants remains difficult to determine, but potential sources include a contaminated implant, contaminated saline, the surgery itself or the surgical environment, the patient's skin or mammary ducts, or, as suggested by many reports, seeding of the implant from remote infection sites. Late infection usually results from secondary bacteraemia or an invasive procedure at a location other than breasts. Diagnostic and management strategies are proposed and the value of peri-operative surgical prophylaxis is revisited. The current hypothesis of the possible role of low-grade or subclinical infection in the origin of capsular contracture is also reviewed.","Affiliation 1 Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, University of Geneva Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.","Brigitte Pittet , Denys Montandon, Didier Pittet",Lancet Infect Dis,2005 Feb,"Review,Bacterial Infections / etiology*,Bacterial Infections / microbiology,Breast Implants / adverse effects*,Breast Implants / microbiology,Contracture / epidemiology,Contracture / etiology*,Humans,Mammaplasty,Prosthesis-Related Infections / diagnosis,Prosthesis-Related Infections / etiology*,Prosthesis-Related Infections / microbiology,Prosthesis-Related Infections / surgery",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15680779/
